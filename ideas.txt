BIG SERVER SUPPORT

heuristics:
1. Server doesn't have a password set
2. More than 10 players are active in the server

- make bus caller circle thicker the more players there are
- clamp bus icon in circle, not rectangle
- change whiteboard to wait for 80% of players
- press USE on bus to be seated
- fix bus rendergroup
- prevent cancelling when majority of players are on the bus
