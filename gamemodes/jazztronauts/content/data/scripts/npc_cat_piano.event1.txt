	>You could have sworn you saw the Pianist here just now...

b1:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_singer*
	Hurry up, hurry up!
	They'll see you!
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker player_dummy*
	Who are you talking abou-
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Singer dead sprints past both of you! 
	On instinct, you dive into the hiding spot the pianist
	is in.
	
	
	player:
	&resp1a:
		Whatever this is, I'm not getting involved. (Exit)
	&resp2a:
		Wow. You look like shit.
	&resp3a:
		Why, exactly are we hiding from the singer?
		
###### Branch 1 (early exit)
resp1a:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	I see how it is. Leaving me to handle the consequences of my actions solo, huh?
	I'll remember this when the revolution comes.
	&resp1b
	
resp1b:
	Get out of here, then. I owe you one, so I'll cover for you too. This time.
	&exit
	
###### Branch 2 
resp2a:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	Rich words coming from an abomination in the face of 
	a distraught and regretful god. 
	Keep your voice down.
	&resp3a
	
###### Branch 3 (also merge point)
resp3a:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	They know. I thought i'd timed it right, and they were conked out on top of
	the bar, but no, this is the one fucking time they break routine and come to 
	check on their glorified tamagotchi collection at the mewseum before the fifth nap.
	They saw everything.
	
	player:
	&resp4a:
		Fifth nap?
	&resp5a:
		Gee, it's almost like your idea was... bad.
	&resp6a:
		Have fun with that. (exit)
		
###### Branch 4
resp4a:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist stares at you. You stare back.
	The Silence extends, and becomes crippilingly awkward.
	A rich array of emotions cross over her face.
	&resp4b
	
resp4b:
	>It's almost like she's going through the five stages of grief in the 
	thirty second conversational void as she evaluates your sense of
	priorities. Then, her head bows, and she sighs.
	&resp4c
	
resp4c:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	Yes. The Singer takes nine naps a day.
	They have designated spots for each.
	
	player:
	&resp5a:
		Gee, it's almost like your idea was... bad.
	&resp1a:
		Have fun with that. (exit)
		
###### Branch 5

resp5a:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	And I suppose none of your ideas have ever backfired *player*, and you're
	the sole clean and pure being in this universe who has never made a goddamn
	mistake. Forgive me. I didn't know I was in the presence of the chosen one,
	the saviour - 
	&resp5b
	
resp5b:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist is getting worked up, as evident by the fact that her tail has
	been lashing around more and more. And also the fact that she's basically 
	just shouting at this point.
	&resp5c
	
resp5c:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	Oh, how I would ever have concluded that perhaps I had fucked up, were it not
	for your astute commentary on my current state?
	Truly, I am blessed!
	&resp5d
	
resp5d:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Singer appears to have drifted into view behind the Pianist.

		Uh-
	&merge1:
		Hey, Pi-
	&merge1:
		Shut the fuc-

	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Singer sprints over to you both and....
	ineffectually shoves the Pianist's shoulder. Their eyes are brimming
	with tears, and they tap agitatedly at their tablet while bouncing
	in clear distress.
	&merge2
	
merge2:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_singer*
	>The Singer taps out a message\: They are not mad,
	they're just disappointed.
	&merge3
	
merge3:
	>...The singer pulls at their ears, tail trashing, tucks the tablet
	under their left arm and flips the Pianist the double bird.
	
	They might actually be a bit mad.
	&merge4
	
merge4:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	Look, Pipes. 
	I'm sorry you had to see that.
	&merge5
	
merge5:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_singer*
	>The Singer chastises the Pianist for not listening.
	The problem is not that they saw what happened in the mewseum.
	It's the fact that it happened in the first place.
	&merge6
	
merge6:
	*setspeaker player_dummy*
	>You get the feeling this is a pretty common conversation.
	&merge7
	
merge7:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_piano*
	I was bored! I get antsy when i'm bored. And I listen! I didn't
	cause any structural damage this time!
	&merge8
	
merge8:
	All your little pets will be good as new in no time.
	The only harm done is to my bank account.
	&merge9

	*setspeaker npc_cat_singer*
	>The Singer makes a clear 'zip it' gesture at the Pianist.
	&merge10
	
merge10:
	>The Singer turns their attention to you. 
	They write out an apology for the Pianist getting you involved in
	a personal hissy fit, and sends you on your way.
	&merge11
	
merge11:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>As you leave, you look over your shoulder and see the Singer pass
	the Pianist $2500 and give her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.
	&merge12
	
merge12:
	>The Pianist looks, for a moment, almost ashamed.
	*mark_seen*
	You decide that you've played your part here, and head back to the others.
