	>This is where the Pianist said the party was. You think.
	All of the cats are here, seated around the table. 
	...the rotten chinese takeout you got is here too.

	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Oh, hey playername. I wasn't sure if you were coming. But I figured,
	who turns down free food, right?
	So I set a place.
	
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Thanks, but i'll take mine to go. I've got stuff to do. (Exit)
	&r2a1:
		I don't actually know how old that stuff is, you know. I mean, I sniffed it, but.
		Are you sure you want to eat that?
	&r3a1:
		I will literally never turn down free food.

	>The Pianist looks, momentarily, crestfallen.
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Oh. Sure. I know how it is, being a busy interdimensional thief. I saved some wonton
	soup for you, try not to stain the trolley seat.
	&r1a3
	
r1a3:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	I do hope you'll be able to join us in our next little gathering.
	Stay safe!

	it's fiiiine. what's the worst that could happen? it's not like life or death has any 
	meaning beyond what you give it so sit down grab some chopsticks and join us in embracing
	the culinary void that is takeout of incredibly dubious origin.
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Thanks for the stirring speech, Camus. But no legit, it's cool.
	All of the foodstuffs we find are preserved in the state of their creation.
	How else do you think we fuckin' eat?
	
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Thanks, but i'll take mine to go. I've got stuff to do. (Exit)

###### Branch 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist and Singer clap their hands together. The Pianist looks embarrassed and
	seems to be pretending she did that to kill a bug.
	You let her think it worked.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Sweet. Here, I saved you some wonton soup.
	
	>She pushes one of the boxes over to you.
	&r3a3
	
r3a3:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>Everyone in the room eats in silence. It's only mildly awkward.

	Say, playername. Have you ever played a round of G-
	&r3a5
	
r3a5:

	SO ABOUT WHY I CALLED YOU ALL HERE TODAY.

	&r3a6
	
r3a6:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Pianist. No chainsaws in The Bar Samsara.
	We've talked about this.
	&r3a7
	
r3a7:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Firstly, you're repressing my free spirit with that rule and I resent it.
	Secondly, it's not a chainsaw. 
	It's something better.
	&r3a8

r3a8:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist produces a Recorder from her jacket pocket, 
	and places it on the table.
	
	The Cellist quickly stands up from his seat.
	&r3a9

r3a9:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	weeeeeeeell it was nice hanging out with y'all thanks for the food but i need
	to find literally anywhere else to be at this point in time so uh if you'll excuse

	thirty seconds
	&r3a10

r3a10:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Come now, don't be like that.

	outer ears on my own
	&r3a12	
	
r3a12:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	>The Singer puts their tablet on the table.

	&r3a14

r3a14:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer points more emphatically.
	&r3a15	

r3a15:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	>...the cellist quietly sits down in his seat.
	&r3a16
	
r3a16:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Thank you. So, I found this, and I thought i'd give you a treat.
	I've been practicing.

	&r3a17
	
r3a17:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist plays the recorder.
	
	...it's.... something alright.
	&r3a18
	
r3a18:
	>As soon as the song is over the Pianist hurls the recorder
	across the room and storms out!
	
	player:
	&m1:
