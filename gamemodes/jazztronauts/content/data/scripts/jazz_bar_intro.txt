     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Greetings honored guests! It’s time for the much awaited explanation that
     we promised you!
     &a1

a1:
     Allow me to formally welcome you to the Bar Samsara!
     &a2

##Production note:
##This line is accompanied with an establishing shot of the stage. 
##The bartender is standing still, center stage, with the cellist and the 
##singer jazz hands-ing behind him, at his flanks. Further behind him is a
##giant sign saying “Welcome New Players!” lit up. The pianist is taking a
##nap on some crates below it.

     *setspeaker narrator*
     >The stage lights up! The other 3 cats are here too it appears.
     &a3

a3:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     We’ve done this a few times so let me preemptively answer a few of 
     the more immediate concerns I’m sure you have.
     &a4

a4:
     You are currently inside of the Bar Samsara. I am the Bartender 
     here. It is an establishment we run where beings from all dimensions
     can stop in for a visit to relax and refresh.
     &a5

a5:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     also its a front for a notorious gang of omnidimensional thieves 
     that break into concepts and narratives rather than just physical 
     places in conventional space-time
     &a6

a6:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     He’s talking about us, just in case that went over your head.
     &a7

a7:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     And you as well, hopefully. But we’ll get to that in a minute.
     &a8

a8:
     The Bar Samsara is a hub, of sorts. A plethora of dimensions and 
     worlds have free access to this spot in local space-time. Naturally,
     that access goes both ways. We can enter those other worlds from 
     here. Which is where you come in.
     &a9

a9: 
     Let’s cut to the chase. We would like to hire you to forcibly break 
     into dimensions that you do not belong to, steal everything you can,
     and then give it to us.
     &a10

a10:
     You get a cut of the take, of course. We will also give you free 
     room and board for the duration of your stay, and access to special
     tools developed by us.
     &a11

a11:

     There is danger involved, but the results of failure are a lot less
     complicated for players than they are for us. Suffice to say, we’re 
     incentivized to have help. That said...
     &a12

a12:
     As I said earlier, you may absolutely refuse. We will immediately 
     return you to the main menu, and you’ll be free to go on with your
     day. This is an agreement between two parties, not a hostage 
     situation.
     &a13

a13:
     So...what do you say?
     player:
          &a14: Yeah okay, that sounds good.
          &lisaneedsbraces: Give me benefits, and yes.
          &why: No.


### VIDEO GAMES SUCK ACTUALLY
why:
     Ah, well. It’s not the sort of job for everyone. Still, though, you
     heard us out, and I appreciate that.
     &why2

why2:
     As agreed, you’ll be sent back to the main menu. Goodbye.
     &exit

     <kick player from server>?


### DENTAL PLAN 
lisaneedsbraces:
     Benefits...? You’re the first one to think of asking for that. 
     I don’t see why we couldn’t set that up, though I’m not sure 
     how often you’ll need a dental plan in this world.
     &a14

### MAIN BRANCH

a14:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     oh thank god finally we can stop almost dying in shitty roleplaying
     maps
     &a15

a15:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     Gonna have to find some other way to kill you.
     &a16

     *setspeaker cat_singer*
     >The Singer runs over to the edge of the seat and starts jumping 
     up and down.
     &a18

a18:
     >They stop for second, and take out a tablet. They type on it 
     furiously.
     &a19

a19:
     >The tablet says “HI IM THE SINGER NICE TO MEET YOU :D”. They’re 
     holding it above their head, and jumping up and down now.
     &a20

a20:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     They can’t read it if you keep moving it, but I think they get the 
     picture. At any rate, welcome aboard! It’s good to have you all 
     with us.
     &a21

     *setspeaker narrator*
     >The Pianist hops off her box and walks onto the stage.

     We should get ‘em up to speed, Boss. Shard tank’s not gonna fill 
     itself.
     &a23

a23:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Of course. Now then, how would you like a rundown of the 
     operation we have here? I recommend it.
     Player
          &a24: Yeah sure, clue me in. (View Tutorial)
          &b1: No thanks, I’m good. (Leave)

### I'M GOOD SEEN THIS BEFORE
b1:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     As you wish, I’m sure you’ll be able to figure it all out. Let’s 
     get to work, gang.
     &b2

b2:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     No nonsense eh? We’ll get along just fine. Swing by the store and 
     we’ll get you some gear. Be bustin’ skulls before you know it.
     &b3

b3:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     just to make sure, your job is to look out for shards. they look 
     like someone made crack rocks out of rainbows, you’ll know em when 
     you see em. get a lot of them.
     &ending

### PREPARE YOUR ASS FOR TEXT

a24:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Certainly. We’ve got a number of facilities here in the Bar Samsara.
     The most important one is the trolley depot. The trolley is how you 
     visit a map once you've selected it. Once all players have taken a 
     seat, it'll take care of the rest.
     &a25

a25:
     You've also been provided with a modified pistol that acts as a
     beacon for the trolley's dimensional navigating systems. If enough
     players target the same spot with it, it will break into the map 
     from that spot. I suggest you take care to not stand in its way.
     &a26

a26:
     Once it's arrived, it will leave the same way it arrived, once all
     players are sitting inside.
     &a27

a27:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     A little past the depot is the camp you’ll be living in, and the 
     machine that lets you find new worlds to break into. Don’t worry, 
     it’s pretty simple to operate.
     &a28

a28:
     There are only two buttons worth a damn on it after all. 
     The big clunky lookin’ tv is what you use to look for new levels,
     and the weird thing in the center is what you use to select one.
     &a29

a29:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     It looks complicated, though, so to make it even simpler, we’ve 
     marked the consoles you need to use with a Green or Red light. 
     Look for that, and you’ll get it in no time.
     &a30

a30:
     Just remember, Browse on the tv and Select the Level on the center 
     basin.
     &a31

a31:
     Moving on, let's talk about the prop snatcher.
     &a32

a32:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     y’know that jury rigged stun baton I selflessly donated to you all 
     in bonezone.bsp or wherever
     &a33

a33:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     You dropped it down a vent.
     &a34

a34:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     The prop snatcher allows you to steal any prop from a map. Once you 
     come back to the bar, you can exchange the props you’ve stolen for
     money. All you need do is pull the lever in the money den, and we’ll
     handle the rest.
     &a35

a35:
     We should note, that the money gained from stealing props is shared
     between you and your friends. Every player receives their own 
     individual share of money based on the total cash value of all props
     stolen on the server, regardless of who stole it.
     &a36

a36:
     This means you don't have to worry about falling behind! You should
     feel free to spend money when you get it, as you're not hogging it
     from any other player. Players who join late or only every so often 
     will receive money based on the server's progress, too.
     &a37

a37:
     Of course, we also know that it's common for friends to compete with
     each other to see who can steal the most, so we've implemented a few
     ways to check on those statistics, with a leaderboard in the money
     den. You'll always be on an even playing field, so it's all skill!
     &a38

a38:
     There are two other ways to make money. The first is a flat cash 
     reward to all players for each shard acquired, and the second is 
     talking to us around the Bar Samsara when we have requests for you.
     We'll make sure you're compensated fairly for your work.
     &a39

a39:
     Eventually you’ll find a way to ransack that’s unique to you, 
     and that’s when it gets good. On that subject, let’s talk about the
     Store in the bar next.
     &a40

a40:
     I am the Bartender. As my name suggests, I am the one who tends 
     the bar. You can spend the money you’ve gained here for new 
     equipment, or to level up your tools and allow you to explore and 
     steal more freely and easily.
     &a41

a41:
     Speaking of, you should have a few props stolen already, yes? 
     I recommend the first thing you do is exchange those for money. 
     &a42

a42:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     You should buy the prop snatcher upgrades first, by the way.  
     Shit’ll let you steal the walls and floors of levels an’ stuff.
     &a43

a43:
     *setspeaker cat_singer*
     >The Singer is holding up their tablet, where a bedazzled message 
     informs you that no, seriously, you need those. They are trying 
     really hard not to bounce, it seems.
     &a44

a44:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     having the short term memory of a trash can full of betamax tapes
     i realize that it can be easy to forget to upgrade your shit but
     if you make a habit of hitting up the shop every time you turn in
     props that helps a lot
     &a45

a45:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Well I think that covers everything doesn’t it? Lets ge-
     &a46

a46:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     hey wait up, tell em about the shards 
     &a47

a47:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Ah of course! Right, we ought to explain the number one reason 
     we brought you here. It’s also linked to the period of employment
     you’ll have with us.
     &a48

a48:
     We need you to hunt for objects we call shards in each level you 
     visit. They are naturally occuring spacetime phenomena that can be 
     harvested and we want them, for reasons.
     &a49

a49:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     yep, reasons
     &a50

a50:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     Mmmm, reasons.
     &a51

a51:
     *setspeaker cat_singer*
     >The Singer nods sagaciously.
     &a52

a52:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Again, we’ll pay you and whoever you’re working with a flat rate 
     for each one found. It doesn’t matter who found it. We need a 
     minimum of 100, but will pay you the same rate for each shard you 
     find after 100.
     &a53

a53:
     Once we’ve got the amount we need, you’ll be free to go whenever you
     wish! No strings, no stipulations. Just an amicable parting on your 
     terms. 
     &a54

a54:
     Player
          &areyouawizard: Wait do you need these shards for like, evil stuff?
          &business: Fair enough, can I get started?

### YO YOU ARENT GONNA BETRAY ME RIGHT

     the writing was always garbage anyway

wiz2:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     The shards themselves are completely harmless anyways. You’ll see 
     why when you spot one - they make a really warm sound, and are 
     generally just calming to be near.
     &wiz3

wiz3:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     It’s still a fair question to ask, it's rare to acquire strange and
