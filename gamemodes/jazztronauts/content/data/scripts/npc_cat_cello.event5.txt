###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Bar Samsara... ...huh.
	3 of the cats are here, and they look surprisingly worried. This
	is concerning.
	&b1

b1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	There you are.
	Listen, the Cellist needs your help.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	He came in here a little while ago drinking something, and got 
	more agitated until he threw the empty glass across the room and
	stormed out.
	&b3
	
b3:
	If this has to do with all those milk cartons he somehow
	happened to find, I think I know what's wrong.
	&b4
	
b4:
	I won't mince words. The Cellist is not well, and he keeps putting
	all his hopes on magic cures and instant solutions. I think his 
	latest attempt just failed.
	&b5
	
b5:
	Such failures are rarely good for his state of mind to 
	begin with, but combined with his recent mood...
	&b6
	
b6:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer anxiously explains that the Cellist won't listen to
	any of them, not even when the Singer tried to make it clear they
	were more concerened than upset with a peace offering of a
	weighted blanket covered in weed leaf decals.
	&b7
	
b7:
	> "If he won't listen to us then maybe he'll listen to you??
	He's talked to you more than he's talked to anyone else we've
	met in a Really Long Time even though he was on a downswing!!!
	That's really impressive!!! "
	&b8
	
b8:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> This is the last event in the Cellist's questline. You may
	want to give the other players a heads up that you'll be busy
	for a bit, if you continue.
	&b9
	
b9:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> Additionally, the following scene contains a more serious 
	depiction of the Cellist's many issues. An option has been 
	provided below to skip it and read a summary instead, if you
	would prefer to avoid playing through it. No penalty.
	player:
	&m1:
		Point me where I need to go.
	&r1a1:
		I'll go make sure he's alright. (Read Summary)
	&r2a1:
		I need some time before that kind of talk. 
		I'll be back when I'm ready. (exit)


###### OPTIONAL SUMMARY. Y'know the one we have in case someone who has these same issues plays our game.
###### so that they don't get reminded of the shit that they are attempting to forget about via escapism and videogames.
###### please don't be weird about inclusivity features, if you are reading this file purely to try and own us for doing this.		
r1a1:
	*hide*
	*txout*
	*setspeaker narrator*
	*wait .1*
	*show*
	Upon reaching the roof, the Cellist lashes out at you in anger,
	thinking you're there only to pity him or give him hollow
	platitudes, before apologizing for losing his temper again.
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	He explains the reasons for his substance abuse (primarily self-
	loathing), and dismissively writes himself off as a lost cause 
	only kept around by the other cats out of pity, and just wants them 
	to throw him out already so he can finish self-destructing.
	&r1a3
	
r1a3:
	Upon being pressed, he admits he knows they care, but hates himself
	for disappointing them when he relapses into bad habits while they 
	try to help, and tries to push them away for their own good, as he
	thinks that will make them stop hurting themselves for him.
	&r1a4
	
r1a4:
	You explain that deliberately shutting his friends out only causes 
	them more pain in the long run, as they're willing to accept slip-ups
	and instability to help their friend get better, but shutting them out
	and making them watch him fall apart is like torture in comparison.
	&r1a5
	
r1a5:
	Realizing this makes the Cellist's emotional dam break, and he falls
	apart crying. You sit with him until he calms down, both of you knowing
	his problems are far from resolved, but he now understands what
	his friends are trying to do, and will let them help. *mark_seen*
	&exit
	
###### EARLY EXIT
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	That's perfectly understandable, but please, once you're
	ready, come back as soon as you can.
	&exit
	
###### MERGE Point

	He's on the patio that overlooks the lake.

	> "You’re gonna do great, I know it! ✧/ᐠ-ꞈ-ᐟ\"

	Thank you.

	*show*
	i suppose you think you're here to help me.
	&m5
	
m5:
	to say something magical that takes all of the shit on my soul
	away, to channel mr. rogers and give me a nice three minute pep
	talk that reminds me it's okay to be sad sometimes and not know
	how to handle it and that it'll be okay some time soon
	&m6
	
m6:
	do you realize how many fucking times i've heard what you want
	to say to me? are you so naive to think that no, clearly, all
	he needs is to think properly and hear the right words and 
	surely he'll turn his whole life around?
	&m7
	
m7:
	that he doesn't know he's a failure? do you have the slightest
	fucking idea of who you are talking to? of WHAT you are talking
	to? do you have ANY IDEA what you're advising?
	&m8
	
m8:
	i don't WANT help! i don't WANT to be pitied by a fucking
	useless ephemeral piece of shit like you!
	
	i'm...    i...
	&m9

m9:
	I'm sorry *player*.
	I'm just so tired of being so tired.
	player:
	&concern:
		Look, if you need space right now, I'll give it to you, but i'm
		concerned about you.
	&others:
		The others are all worried sick about you.
	&yoga:
		I know everybody suggests it, but have you tried-

###### RESPONSE 1		
concern:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	I... I appreciate the offer. And the concern. But I don't know what 
	I need right now.
	&concern1
	
concern1:
	...Well. I do know what I think I need, but enough of me's still 
	stubborn enough to dig its heels in on the matter.
	So I take the next best option.
	&n1
	
###### RESPONSE 2
others:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	Hah. More like worried sick OF me. They didn't even bother coming
	up with you, did they? I know what the lot of them really think of
	me, even if they don't admit it to themselves. It's just a matter
	of time until they get sick of rebuilding torched bridges.
	&n1
	
###### RESPONSE 3
yoga:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	Please, I know you want to help, but I promise you I've tried
	meditation, I've tried exercise, I've tried mindfulness, I've
	tried every god damn granola hippie mom yoga program that exists.
	None of it can fix that I, fundamentally, am the problem.
	&n1
	
	
###### MERGE
n1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	You think I fled this far into altered states for fun? No, it's
	because I can't fucking stand myself. Being alone in my head,
	with everything clear, with nothing between me and myself...
	nobody could pitch me a more convincing Hell.
	&n2
	
n2:
	Maybe you can understand that. I really hope you don't. But the
	funny thing about running from your problems is that you eventually
	have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place.
	&n3
	
n3:
	That's what happened to me until I got...
	lucky's not the right word.
	&n4
	
	
n4:
	Years ago, I saw everything. Whatever I did, whatever I was on,
	whatever my frame of mind was, it all aligned. I could see
	everything in its place. I can't even describe what I saw and
	felt, because I can't remember it anymore.
	&n5
	
n5:
	In that fleeting glimpse, that trip that lasted ten thousand
	years in the span of a heartbeat, I was finally comfortable in
	my own skin. I knew where I belonged. I knew where everything
	was going, what things were building up twoards...
	&n6
	
n6:
	...and then I crashed.
	&n7
	
n7:
	It all was stripped from me as I came down. That sense of oneness,
	that fulfillment, all of it gone except the echo of what it felt
	like. I was left with nothing but that memory. That mockery.
	&n8
	
n8:
	I needed to see it all again.
	To feel it again.
	To escape again.
	&n9
	
n9:
	And that let me to what you see now. A burnt-out drug-addled wreck
	chasing a mirage. It's been so long i'm not even sure if that 
	memory is real anymore, or some gaslight phantom my mind's come
	up with to justify its self-destruction.
	&n10
	
n10:
	I'm useless. I don't contribute anything to this crew anymore.
	I'm just a wallowing piece of shit coasting on old glories and 
	sympathies until they realize-
	&n11
	
n11:
	-realize that I'm more trouble than I'm worth,
	and that I'll never live up to my "potential", 
	and then they'll throw me out on my ass.
	&n12
	
n12:
	So just, leave me alone. Let me destroy what's left of me in peace.
	If there's nothing left of me to care, or there's anybody left to
	care for me...
	&n13
	
n13:
	.....that's all I can hope for anymore.
	player:
	&n14:
		Are you trying to convince me of that, or yourself?
		
n14:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	....
	player:
	&n15:
		I don't pretend to know what you're going through, but I can tell you\:
		you're wrong about your friends. They see you hurting, and want to help.
		
n15:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	And when they try I just end up hurting them back. You saw what happened with
	the Singer. They didn't deserve that shit. None of them do. I care about 
	them too much to see them go through that.
	player:
	&n16:
		So you think that hurting them on purpose makes up for hurting 
		them on accident?
	
n16:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	.......
	player:
	&n17:
		Shutting them out only hurts them more, not less. They keep holding their hands out 
		for you even when they get burned sometimes. They know what they're dealing with.
		They know you want help. They care about you enough to wait for you.
		
n17:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	.............
	player:
	&n18:
		Take our hand.
		
n18:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> With that, something inside the Cellist finally breaks open, and he
	slumps to the ground as a wail tears itself free from his throat. You
	sit with him as his sobbing wracks his body, arm around his shoulder,
	hand on his.
	&n19
	
n19:
	> You sit with him until his tears are all spent. You both know how
	long his road will be, and how many times he'll stumble. 
	Habits don't change overnight-
	&n20
	
n20:
	-But any long trip feels shorter with good friends to share it with,
	and the Cellist has finally realized it's time to let
	some walk with him. *mark_seen*
