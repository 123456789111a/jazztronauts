###### START	
	*setspeaker narrator*
	*show*
	>The Pianist appears to be doing situps in the performance hall.
	
	She notices you pretty quickly.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	You.
	
	I've been waiting for you to show up. C'mere, and lower your voice.
	&b2
	
b2:
	Listen, PLAYERNAME. We've been through a lot together. 
	We've bonded over the acquisition of suspended-animation takeout.
	And I just decided that means we're friends now.
	&b3
	
b3:
	I know, it's a lot to take in, remember to breathe.
	My trust is not lightly bewtowed, but I think you've earned it.
	But we should not forget our origins.
	&b4
	
b4:
	So, we're gonna cement this friendship in an aptly symbolic and
	appropriate way:
	Which is a very fancy and roundabout way of me telling you that we're gonna
	steal more shit for me.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		I don't like the look in your eye and I don't want to cause another incident
		with the Singer. So i'm gonna have to pass on whatever you've got planned here. (exit)
	&r2a1:
		Or, and hear me out here - we could sit down, have a drink, and talk about
		our feelings and shared interests?
	&r3a1:
		I fucking live to steal.
		
		
###### BRANCH 1 (early exit)
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Well, piss. I hadn't really planned for tha, but.
	I respect your autonomy, pal. Go be 'reliable' or whatever boring thing you
	have in mind instead, if that's what you really want to do.
	*mark_seen*
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 2 
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist stares at you, head tilted to one side. 
	You can almost see the wheels turning in her head before she shakes it and grins.
	&r2a2

r2a2:
	We don't have that kind of relationship, buddy.
	Our relationship is based on a different kind of give and take.
	The kind where you take shit from other people and give it to me.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		I don't like the look in your eye and I don't want to cause another incident
		with the Singer. So i'm gonna have to pass on whatever you've got planned here. (exit)
	&r3a1:
		I fucking live to steal.
		
###### BRANCH 3 (Also merge point)
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist claps her hands together and beams, tail lashing in excitement.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Hell fucking yeah you do.
	&r3a3

r3a3:
	I'm gonna lift the package myself, I just need you to be my lookout.
	And our mark is a fucking moron with no spacial awareness to speak of.
	It's an easy job. C'mon let's move.

*show*
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Bar Samsara, Cellist's Room....
	
	The Cellist is inside, surrounded by... substances. He looks pretty 
	unconscious.
	&m2
	
m2:
	>The Pianist holds up her paw, then points at the Cellist's... workbench?
	The range of paraphernalia on display is both a marvel, and a probable violation
	of pretty much every drug law there is.
	&m3
	
m3:
	>She turns to you, and speaks in a barely audible whisper.
	&m4
	
m4:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Okay. Here's the deal.
	In, out. Ten seconds, tops.
	
	I'm after that.
	&m5

m5:
	camera cuts to show a joint on a table here
	I know how this motherfucker works. All those high concept, probably explosive
	materials?
	
	That's the soft shit.
	&m6
	
m6:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	And I want to get.
	
	Fucked. Up.
	&m7

m7:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I don't wanna be able to think for a week and I want to make really stupid
	life choices. You justt watch for him twitching.
	player:
	&m8:
		Why don't you just ask h-
	&m8:
		This is a really bad id-
	&m8:
		You're gonna go blind you kn-
		
m8:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist ignores you, stalking twoards the bench. She carefully steps around the 
	soused Cellist, and the discarded... stuff... surrounding him.
	&m9
	
m9:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>Her tail rigid behind her, she leans in...
	and in...
	and...
	got it!
	&m10
	
m10:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Cellist starts to stir and you frantically signal for your heist partner to get
	out of there. The two of you retreat to a secluded corner to share the spoils.
	&m11
	
m11:
*hide*
*txout*
*txin*
*wait .25*
*show*
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	We fucking did it. We have scored, the Good Shit.
	He knows that I know he hides the hard stuff, so of course he left it out in the
	open as something obvious and innocuous. Cellist is smarter than he looks, you know.
	&m12
	
m12:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>She lights the thing with a blowtorch, which is the kind of excessive action you have
	come to expect. She takes a deep drag, ears flattening against her head and pupils
	dialating.
	&m13
	
m13:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah.
	
	>You smell something... floral? Is that lavender? And camomile?
	&m14
	
m14:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	The contract of friendship is sealed.
	
	>The Pianist's eyes go blank, and she falls backward onto the floor.
	&m15
	
m15:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>Nudging her lightly, you establish that she's not dead. 
	Moments later, snoring confirms that she's just fast asleep.
	The air smells delightful.
	&m16
	
m16:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	As you turn to leave her to her nap, the Cellist steps into view and 
	squats beside her.
	&m17
	
m17:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	fucking knew that'd work
	she always assumes i have the capacity for mind games and pysches herself out
	into doing something predictable.
	thanks for enabling her.
	&m18
	
m18:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	oh, it's probably worth noting she didn't actually get my Good Shit
	you'd be able to tell if she did by the constant screaming
	&m19
	
m19:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i just rolled a blunt full of aromatherapy stuff i stole from bed bath and beyond
	it seems to be working. now maybe she'll sleep for more than an hour and wake up
	chill and give us all some peace and quiet for a day or two.
	&m20
	
m20:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Cellist nods to himself, cleary satisfied, and leaves.
	*mark_seen*
	Bemused, you snub out the joint and leave the sleeping cat be.
