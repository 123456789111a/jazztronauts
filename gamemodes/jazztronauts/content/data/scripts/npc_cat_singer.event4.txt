###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> Passing by the bar, you spot the Singer and the Bartender.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Bartender is reading whatever the Singer has written on their tablet
	with great rapture. Her expression shifts into a broad smile, and the
	Singer claps.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	That's fantastic! I'm very impressed at the tremendous strides your program
	has made in such a short time since you've had the aid of our guest.
	&b3
	
b3:
	Speaking of which, welcome! Take a seat, and I'll mix you something up.
	Free of charge, since you've been such an invaluable research assistant
	for the Singer.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Sorry, I just wanted to say hi. I'll take a rain check on that, though. (exit)
	&r2a1:
		If i'm a research assistant I expect to be credited on the paper when you
		release your findings to CATScan or something.
	&r3a1:
		Cheers. So what's up?
		
###### BRANCH 1 EARLY EXIT
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	The Singer smiles and waves as you head off, and the Bartender salutes you with an
	empty glass. They immediately return to their conversation and you hear something
	about an 'ascension program' as you walk away.
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer looks legitimately offended and then opens up their thesis-in-progress
	to show that you have in fact already been credited in full as a research partner.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Sorry, I just wanted to say hi. I'll take a rain check on that, though. (exit)
	&r3a1:
		Cheers. So what's up?
	
###### BRANCH 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer pats the seat next to them, sliding the tablet over so you can share in
	the conversation. Apparently they have been telling the Bartender all about the 
	behaviours they've observed from the new Mewseum resident you acquired for them,
	and of some new behaviours older subjects have displayed in response.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	> The Singer runs a program in which they expose the NPC's to different things you
	have stolen to see whether there's any changes in their routines. At present, they're
	essentially animatronics. They have no reaction on any level to stimuli outside of
	pre-programmed behaviours.
	&m1
	
m1:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	I must say, *player*, you've been reminding us of someone we used to know as of late.
	It's been delightful.
	&m2
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer agrees. It has been wonderful having help with the Mewseum again. Their
	last helper was also very good at finding, niche, objects. They recount the time in which
	their assistant spent three weeks trawling the Voidway searching for a specific level
	trigger that the Singer had theorized could revolutionize the Mewseum's storage system.
	&m3
	
m3:
	> They preen as you read this, as it was a correct hypothesis.
	&m4
	
m4:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	They were always just as excited about the potential as you were.
	&m5
	
m5:
	Thank you, *player*.
	We've all greatly appreciated your presence and assistance here.
	&m6
	
m6:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer bounces in their seat as they nod. They're very thankful to count you
	among their friends. You share a plate of exceptionally good pastriest and a couple
	of drinks, and it's time well spent. *mark_seen*
