###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Home Base... 
	It's the usual scene. Map browsing, quiet lazing about, the hum of the shard tank...
	Might not be a bad chance to sneak in a nap- *emitsound sound/weapons/mortar/mortar_shell_incoming1.wav*%% -?
	Fuck was that sound?
	&b1
	
b1:
	*shake 3* *emitsound sound/weapons/mortar/mortar_explode3.wav* > !!!! Something exploded??
	It came in the direction of the Performance Hall... 
	You decide to check it out.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*hide*
	*txout*
	*txin*
	*wait .1*
	*show*
	> You make it to the Performance Hall relatively quickly as you w-
	...wait did  the Cellist fly past you just now? You turn around to see
	what launched him and see the Pianist charging after the Cellist!
	&b3
	
b3:
	> Well this suddenly makes a lot more sense. The Singer walks up next to you
	as you finish putting 1 and 1 together. This must be pretty common if they
	aren't freaking out.
	&b4
	
b4:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I wasn't done talking, so get back here you clay-brained asshead and apologize!
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Uh. I'll just be, leaving, now. (Exit)
	&m1:
		That was creative.
	&m1:
		You nearly hit me, you know.
	
	
###### BRANCH 1 EARLY Exit
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	good idea you probably don't recover from injuries incompatible with life nearly as 
	fast as i do or at all come to think of it
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer tells you not to worry about it as you pass.
	They have this under control.
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 2 
m1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i am a cat of incredibly specific principles and i refuse to apologize for the Truth
	and the Truth is that the limp bizkit cover of behind blue eyes is the objectively
	superior version
	&m2
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	> The Pianist is pretty obviously pissed about this.
	&m3
	
m3:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Blithely ignoring the crackling tension in the air, the Singer starts tapping away
	on their tablet.
	&m4
	
m4:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> Surprisingly enough, this act alone is enough to make the Pianist AND the Cellist
	look visibly mortified.
	&m5
	
m5:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> They hold it straight above their head when they've finished so all three of you can
	see the screen\: "I was sleeping motherfuckers so now we're going to have a Talk about
	healthy conflict resolution （=Φ ω Φ=)”
	&m6
	
m6:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	aw c'mon pipes i have through absolutely no fault of my own been grevously injured
	and assaulted and i for one implore you to consider the fact that you only compound
	my emotional and physical pain with your use of shit like （=Φ ω Φ=)
	&m7
	
m7:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	How the fuck did you say-
	
	Nevermind.
	&m8
	
m8:
	Look it's fine. You told me to ask for an apology when the Cellist does something 
	stupid and I did. He didn't give it.
	&m9
	
m9:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	having a different and scientifically correct opinion isn't doing something stupid 
	but i can sure tell you what is as soon as i remember the fancy latin name for 
	whatever logical fallacy involves throwing explosives at the other debater
	&m10
	
m10:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer sighs. 
	The other two immediately avert their eyes.
	&m11
	
m11:
	> They give the Cellist and Pianist a reassuring pat on the arm before typing out a 
	longer message\: 
	&m12
	
m12:
	> "You both have so much in common I wish you'd talk things out instead of escalating!!
	You could have had a really neat discussion about the merits of the things you like but
	noooooo straight to property damage. Why are you Like This."
	&m13
	
m13:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i for one blame socie-
	&m14
	
m14:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer, having somehow shut the Cellist up, informs him that he is far from blameless,
	specifically tried to provoke the Pianist with inflammatory statements, and shout cut it the
	fuck out. Frankly, it's the kind of behaviour they'd expect from kittens.
	&m15
	
m15:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	...i'm sorry.
	&m16
	
m16:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Yeah, uh. 
	Sorry.
	&m17
	
m17:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> They give both cats a hug and tell you to find them later for another job before
	hopping up on top of the booth and curling up to resume their nap. The Cellist and
	the Pianist go their seperate ways, each looking thoroughly chastised. *mark_seen*
