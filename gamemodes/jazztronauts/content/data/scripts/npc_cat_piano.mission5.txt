	I don't really remember much other than rambling about not killing you.
	I'm a bit of a lightweight and I drank about uhhh sixty percent more 
	than it needs to get me goddamn plastered.

	I feel like I owe the Singer a more substantial apology than a bribe
	of shitty takeout. So I'm gonna need your larceny skills again, *player*.
	This is The Big One.
	&a6
	
a6:
	I need you to get me 3 metrocops. *start 5* For the Mewseum. They don't have any,
	and it'll mean a lot to em'. Of course, I'll compensate you for you

	Hey.
	Don't worry I'm not gonna give you any shit if you haven't finished the job
	yet, this and the horse thing were niche asks, I know.

i1:
	I reckon this'll be the last time I need you to do this sort of thing, my
	"frivolous hiring fees" budget is running a little low and I'll need to see
	our fence before I can make any more poor fiscal descisions.
	&i2
	
i2:
	But I do want to say that. 
	I really appreciate all the help you've been giving me.
	Your company, too.
	It's been.
	&i3
	
i3:
	Nice.
	
	Anyway. Let me know when we're good to go yeah?
