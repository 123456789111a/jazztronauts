	Hey. Sorry if I was.

	Weird. Earlier.

a2:
	I don't really remember much other than ramblin about not killing you.
	I'm a bit of a lightweight and I drank about uhhh sixty perfect more 
	than it needs to get me goddamn plastered.
	&a3
	
a3:
	But you can rest assured that I was being legit and have zero intention
	of putting you on ice.
	&a4
	
a4:
	I've been trying uh, meditation.
	Gives me a lot of time to think. 
	On purpose, I mean.
	&a5
	
a5:
	I feel like I owe the Singer a more substantial apology than a bribe
	of shitty takeout. So I'm gonna need your larceny skills again, PLAYERNAME.
	This is The Big One.
	&a6
	
a6:
	I need you to get me 3 metro cops. For the mewseum. They dont have any,
	and it'll mean a lot to em'. Of course, I'll compensate you for you
	for your efforts. *start 5*
	
	
idle:
	Hey.
	Don't worry I'm not gonna give you any shit if you haven't finished the job
	yet, this and the horse thing were niche asks, I know.
	&i1
	
i1:
	I reckon this'll be the last time I need you to do this sort of thing, my
	"frivolous hiring fees" budget is running a little low and i'll need to see
	our fence before I can make any more poor fiscal descisions.
	&i2
	
i2:
	But I do want to say that. 
	I really appreciate all the help you've been giving me.
	Your company, too.
	It's been.
	&i3
	
i3:
	Nice.
	
	Anyway. Let me know when we're good to go yeah?
