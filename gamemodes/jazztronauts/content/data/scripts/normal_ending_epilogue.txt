    Agreed. Signed and sealed. 
    &a3

    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    yeah i could do with sandblasting the crust of existential
    despair off my brain more often 
    player:
        &a4: How is the bar so pristine? Because I distinctly remember royally fucking it up.

    To reach the Center, you must discard all earthly - or Voidly - attachments. Including 
    your attachments to yourself, which is what the shard juice is for.

    turns out that the distilled essence of creativity can overload your neurons

    if you can’t use your own creative drive stolen is fine
    &a7

a7:

    went on a profound mental journey powered by all those shards you've been stealing
    &a8

    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Should have enough for twenty more visits, easy, thanks to your help gettin’ all 
    that shard goop ready.

    Which I will be placing in the Singer's Mewseum vaults for safekeeping, before you 
    two get any ideas.

    > The Singer nods firmly, and narrows their eyes when both the Cellist and Pianist 
    start to object. They shut up immediately.
