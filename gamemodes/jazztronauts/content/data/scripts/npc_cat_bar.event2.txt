branch1    
    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Yeah this is pretty rare. We’re lucky if we get a movie.

    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    nevermind that it might be a movie where everyone is 100% definitely 
    hammered during the entirety of filming

#### BRANCH 2 (EARLY EXIT)
branch2
    *setspeaker cat_piano*

    *setspeaker narrator*
    > We’ve gotten past the credits, it was a lot of establishing shots 
    of golf courses. The mood is bleak.

c2
    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    fucks sake are we sure this is a cannon films movie cause by now in 
    most of these someone’s gained ten pounds from all the bullets they’ve 
    been filled with, who put on Ingmar Bergman Presents: The PGA Tour
    &c3

c3
    *setspeaker narrator*
    >Suddenly, a Ninja appears behind a middle aged businessman attempting 
    to pitch out of the sandtrap on the 9th hole. This has taken a turn.

c5
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > As if spurred on by the Pianist, the Ninja takes the man’s golf ball, 
    and crushes it to dust in front of him with his bare hands before 
    punching and stabbing everyone in sight. 
    &c6

c6
    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    i would like to formally rescind my complaint and personally thank the 
    inventors of cocaine for everything i am seeing with my eyeballs right now
    &c7

c7
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > The… golf police? Seem to be after the Ninja now. Which is understandable.
    He straight up murders one of them with a shuriken, and the other 
    gets a gun out.
    &c8

    [cats all switch to their HOLY SHIT faces at once]
c8
    >...Holy shit, the Ninja whipped out a blowpipe and shot a dart into the 
    barrel of the cop’s gun as he fired, making it explode.
    &c9

c9
    *setspeaker cat_singer*
    > You have never seen the Singer this riled up. They’re shadow boxing in 
    their seat, and their tail is quite puffed out.

c10
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > So far the Movie has been about 45 minutes of a Ninja owning rich people. 
    Frankly, it’s amazing.
    &c11

c11
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    Ah, this reminds me of the good old days.
    &c12

c12
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > ...The Bartender seems to be talking about how the Ninja is currently in 
    a high speed police chase, and is on top of a police cruiser. He’s pulling 
    out his katana...
    &c13

c13
    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Man c’mon I know where he’s going with this but that thing aint gonna-
    &c14

c14
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > The Ninja has just stabbed a police officer in the skull through the top 
    of their police cruiser. The officer driving the car does not appear to be 
    cool with any part of this.
    &c15

c15
    *setspeaker narrator*
    >Ah, problem solved. The Ninja blinded him by punching him in the eyes. With 
    a shuriken. Through the roof of the car. Again.
    &c16

c16
    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Oh come the fuck on, there’s no way that this guy could puncture the steel of 
    a police car chassis, right? Back me up here, Singer.
    &c17

c17
    *setspeaker cat_singer*
    > The Singer has their tablet in their lap, with a txt doc that just says 
    “FUCK THE POLICE” on it. 72pt font, looks like Impact. Guess they’re 
    rooting for the Ninja.
    &c18

Fade from black

c18
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > There was a really dope car chase. The Ninja took down a helicopter by 
    jumping up to it and uppercutting the pilot. At any rate he’s surrounded 
    by like, 50 dead bodies.
    &c19

c19
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    Well now. I’m sure this is all this movie had. Rather good though, 
    wouldn’t you agree?
    &c20

c20
    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Yeah I got into it at the end. 
    &c21

c21
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > Oh wait something else is happening. Ah, the ninja is putting his hands 
    together and chanting...now he’s spinning in place...
   
    the Ninja is drilling into the earth.
    &c22

c22
    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    yeah sure i’m pretty sure that’s how that works
    &c23

c24
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > Yep. The Ninja is now up to his neck in the earth. There’s an evil laugh 
    sound playing, and the Ninja seems waiting for more cops? It fades to black 
    shortly after, and the credits roll.
    &c25

c25
    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Damn, that’s a hardcore ninja dude. Respect. Never enough blood for him.
    &c26

c27
    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    yo holy shit what if they made a movie where it was like a bloodthirsty 
    ninja but fuckin get this what if it was dracula and dracula’s a ninja now

c28
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > The night devolves into enthusiastic chatting about the film, and B-movies
    in general. They don’t seem to remember that there’s more tapes to watch...
    Ah well, might as well let ‘em have this.*mark_seen*
