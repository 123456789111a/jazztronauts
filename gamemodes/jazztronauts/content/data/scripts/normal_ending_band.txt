#### HOW TO BE HAPPY

     Ah yeah we get this one a lot.

     lesse it was uhhh rob’s turn i think. you want a beat?

     *setspeaker rob*
     Yeah sure.

     >Rungo starts a drum solo of some sort. It’s pretty restrained.
     &h5

h6:
     *setspeaker rob*
     Right, so, you can’t be happy all the time. Gotta have the other side
     of that coin or else it isn’t a coin right? It'd be some sorta 
     mobius strip upon which any image is indistinguishable from own 
     reflection, thus making sadness and happiness identical experiences. 
     &h7

h7:     
     Thing is, ain’t one thing alone what validates a person, they’re big 
     dumb complicated meat machines that have a million different bits all 
     screaming for their attention. There ain't no one key to happiness
     because each and every person has their own unique lock to pop open.
     &h8

h8:
     That don't mean there aren't some general bits that help most people.
     You need a spot that you feel safe in, you need something to do that 
     you find meaning in, and you need a band, people who see your real value. 
     Last one’s the tricky bit.
     &h9

h9:    
     Take a little time to appreciate the world around you. Try new things 
     when you can, even when it’s scary, but don't forget to keep yourself 
     safe neither. Don’t be a dick. And remember that no matter how bad 
     things might seem in the now, one day it’ll just be a memory.
     &h10

h10:
     Man this always turns into a lecture don’t it? 
     &h11

h11:
     *setspeaker georff*
     Yeah no worries Rob, we’ll figure out the perfect spiel for that 
     question one of these days.

### BOMB ASS STICKY BUNS
### A note from Jared, the writer of this branch: 
###
### With being kind to other people and helping friends through rough times being such a fundamental
### part of the story and writing of Jazztronauts, I feel compelled to memorialize the woman who
### quietly taught me how to do that by example. 
###
### The recipe in this conversation branch was contributed in memory of my grandmother, 
### who passed away not long after development of Jazztronauts began. She made this 
### recipe for her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren probably hundreds
### of times between all the holidays, birthdays, and reunions. She kept the recipe secret
### for decades, despite the simplicity, because she enjoyed the mystique (and leverage at holidays).
### She eventually relented and revealed her many secret recipes, but this was the one we all wanted. 
### (Well, that or the snack mix.)
###
### I cannot express through words how much she meant to all of us. 
### She was the kindest person I have ever known.
###
### If you've read this far and not rolled your eyes, thanks. I hope you like these sticky buns
### even half as much as my family does, but I won't give you shit if you don't. They ain't high
### cuisine, like the Bortles say.

stickybuns:

     *setspeaker rungo*
     you better believe we do mate
     &s1

s1:
     *setspeaker rob*
     Alright, so, this here may not be a recipe you’ll see in a 
     restaurant with Michelin stars, but that don’t matter, cause food 
     doesn’t have to be fancy and unique to be special, yeah? 
     &s2

s2:
     *setspeaker podge*
     I can’t promise you these sticky buns will blow your mind, but I 
     can tell you they mean a whole lot to someone, and they’d like 
     to share them with you as a way of saying thanks.
     &s3

s3:
     *setspeaker rungo*
     alright so first things first you’re gonna want to start the evening 
     before the morning you want these. get a 9” by 13” baking pan, or a 
     bundt cake pan, or anything that can hold the ingredients and go 
     in the oven really
     &s4

s4:
     *setspeaker georff*
     You’ll wanna grease up the inside. The classic way’s with a pat of butter, 
     but margarine or cooking spray’ll do you fine too. Then, take a pack of 18 
     frozen yeast rolls, and put ‘em right in, no need to defrost. The original 
     version used Rhodes brand if you can find 'em, but pick what you like.
     &s5

s5:
     *setspeaker podge*
     Next, take a half cup of chopped pecans, half a cup of brown sugar, and half 
     a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix ‘em all up, and cover the rolls with the mix. 
     Half a cup’s about 120ml for all of you who actually use the measuring system 
     most of the world does.
     &s6

s6:
     *setspeaker rungo*
     you can leave out the pecans if you’ve got an allergy or don’t like ‘em 
     it’s a forgiving recipe really
     &s7

s7:
     *setspeaker rob*
     Next thing you do is melt either a half stick or a full stick of butter, 
     or margarine if you prefer, and drizzle that all over the rolls. Depends 
     on how much sauce you want on the buns.
     &s8

s8:
     *setspeaker georff*
     The right answer’s the full stick, by the way. Not that we’ll judge you 
     if you go with half. Maybe encourage you to live a little more though.
     &s9

s9:
     *setspeaker rungo*
     so next thing you do is put that pan in a cold oven and let it sit overnight 
     so the rolls can thaw and deep flavor magic happens. trust me they just don’t  
     taste right if you try speedrunning it
     &s10

s10:
     *setspeaker rob*
     In the morning, set the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit - about 176 celsius - 
     and bake the rolls until they’re done to your taste. The window’s pretty wide, 
     really, depends on if you like em a bit underdone and soft at 15 minutes, or 
     a bit overdone and crunchy at 35.
     &s11

s11:
     *setspeaker podge*
     If you don’t know, try 20 minutes, with an extra five if they don’t seem 
     quite done. Ovens is finicky things.
     &s12

s12:
     *setspeaker rungo*
     then you just take them out, pop them on a tray, and bob’s your uncle
     &s13

s13:
     *setspeaker georff*
     Bomb-ass sticky buns.
     &s14

s14:
     *setspeaker podge*
     And really, is there anything in life better?
