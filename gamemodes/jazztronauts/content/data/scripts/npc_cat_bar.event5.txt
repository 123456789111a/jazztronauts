    >The Bar Samsara...
    You see the Bartender packing supplies into a picnic basket. She 
    beams when she catches sight of you.

    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    Ah! *player*! 
    I was going to come find you, actually. We’re going on a little field
    trip to the hot spring, would you care to join us?

    (This is the last event. You may want to give the other players
    a heads up that you'll be busy for a little while.)
    player:
         &a4: Yeah sure, I’m down for free food.
         &leave: I have some stuff to do, but maybe later? (exit)

    > You had to take a boat, but the gang has finally arrived at a sandy
    little nook in the mountains. 
    &a6
a6:
    >There a pool here, it’s bubbling and steaming. The entire spot is 
    pleasantly warm.
    >The Cellist is the first to break from the group and head towards 
    the pool.

    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    hello again you shitty bubbly siren you. i’m gonna have the dopest 
    nap in you and you cant do a goddamn thing because you're a 
    geological feature and i am a powerful fae idiot

    *setspeaker cat_piano*
    Incredible. I’ve never seen anyone bully the ground so fiercely.

    > The Singer claps, and holds up their tablet: “Yeah fuck him up 
    Socrates!!!!!"

a10:
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > The Singer’s comment appears to have steamed the Cellist’s clams.
    &a11

    call me socrates one more goddamn time pipes c’mere imma put you 
    in an omni-headlock you treacherous little dingus i am clearly

    *setspeaker narrator*
    > The Cellist makes a big show of chasing the Singer around, and they
    seem to be enjoying it judging from all the general horseplay.
    &a13

a13:
    > The Pianist initially critiques their wrestling form, but clues 
    into the joke eventually and settles down.
    &a14

a14:
    > She cracks her knuckles and drops into a wide stance, before her 
    fists whip out and break chunks off a large boulder. This appears to
    be her idea of relaxation??
    &a15
a15:
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    A moment, *player*?
    I could use a helping paw in setting up the picnic spread.  
    &a16

[FADE OUT, IN]

a16:
    *setspeaker narrator*
    > You’re unpacking the basket with the bartender. She’s quietly 
    flattening a blanket against the sand, eyes closed in contentment.
    &a17

a17:
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    You’re a good person, did you know that?
    &a18

a18:
    I could tell before, but I’m sure of it after seeing you watch the 
    others horsing around on the beach. You appear to be able to just, 
    slot into any scenario and take it for what it is.
    &a19

a19:
    I believe that’s a trait that’s not valued as highly as it ought. The
    ability to look at a stranger on their path, be a little confused, 
    but say “let’s see where this ends up.”
    &a20

a20:
    It enriches all parties involved, even if it ends up badly. Sometimes
    that’s as warm as it sounds, and sometimes it’s a very cold truth. 
    But it’s worth it.
    &a21

a21:
    *setspeaker narrator*
    >The Bartender sits down and stares at the pool.
    You take a seat next to her.
    &a22

a22:
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    Did you know that I’m the oldest of the gang? By a rather large 
    margin, too, it seems.
    &a23

a23:
    For a chunk of my life, everything was new and fresh, and that seemed
    like it could last forever. And when it didn’t, I responded in a way 
    I now regret.
    &a24

a24:
    The chunk after that, I appointed myself a judge on all matters. That
    I had the right to erase anything in the first place. That cycle kept
    feeding on itself until I discovered and challenged someone I should
    never have.
    &a25

a25:
    ...I was destroyed. Humbled completely, and the world was a better 
    place as a result. That singular fact was all I could think about 
    for a long time.
    &a26

a26:
    Humiliated and aimless, I limped through the Void with my only my 
    faithful shadow still clinging to me.
    &a27

a27:
    *setspeaker narrator*
    >You catch the Bartender staring warmly at the Pianist as she pauses the think.
    A few seconds later she speaks again.
    &a28

    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    After enough time, we found a second chance in the Samsara. It’s my 
    prison when I need it to be, and my greenhouse when I want it to be. 
    And I love every second of it.
    &a29

a29:
    You know how they say you can’t go home again? That you can never 
    have that first impression, the first time, more than one time. 
    &a30

a30:
    That’s true but awfully bleak. You can’t go back in time, but you can
    expose those around you to that warmth, and it will enrich and 
    incubate them.
    &a31

a31:
    Their discoveries, and how it evolves them? That’s the true reward. 
    That’s how you go home again. There is simply nothing as valuable 
    in the world as it.
    &a32

a32:
    *setspeaker narrator*
    >A harpoon lands between you and the Bartender, puncturing the 
    blanket. Hell of a throw.
    &a33

a33:
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    Ah, it’s about that time I see. Can you help me de-escalate and get 
    everyone ready for a meal?
    &a34

a34:
    *setspeaker narrator*
    >The Bartender gets up and walks towards the others.
    &a35

    >You follow along shortly after.*mark_seen*
