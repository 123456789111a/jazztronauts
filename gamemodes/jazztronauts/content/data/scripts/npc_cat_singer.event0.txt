	*spawn player_dummy playerboy*

###### START
*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Mewseum... 
	The Singer is here, tapping away at their tablet.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> As you approach, the Singer's ears perk up. They turn, and wave when
	they recognize you. Beckoning, they invite you over.
	&b2
	
b2:
	> They rest a paw against their chin of a moment, before making a sweeping
	gesture around the room and tapping out a short message for you.
	&b3:
	
b3:
	> Turning the tablet around, they're clearly trying to take the Bartender's
	earlier tip about not bouncing while you read into consideration. After seeing
	you squint in confustion at the bedazzled, glimmering font... 
	they change it to comic sans.
	&b4
	
b4:
	> Much better. This time you have no problem parsing the message\:
	"HI!!! WELCOME TO THE MEWSEUM!!"
	&b5
	
b5:
	> A pause, followed by an apparently realization that this doesnt explain anything\:
	
	"This is where I archive a copy of everything you steal for us!!! \:･ﾟ✧\(=✪ ᆺ ✪=)/\:･ﾟ✧”
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Sorry, I hate learning. I have somewhere else to be. (Exit)
	&r2a1:
		I'm guessing you named it.
	&r3a1:
		...Why?
		
###### BRANCH 1 EARLY Exit
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer informs you that while they think that's a very sad attitude, they
	understand and hope you come back some other time.
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 2 
	
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer blinks, then shakes their head. Apparently they'd just called it The
	Museum originally, but the Bartender suggested the change.
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	> The Singer bounces in place and adds to the last message\: "It made her so happy!!!
	The others will never admit it and don't you dare tell them I told you
	but they like it too ₍⸍.ʷ̣̫.⸌₎”
	&r2a3
	
r2a3:
	> They put a paw to their mouth in the universal 'shhhh' signal.
	&r2a4
	
r2a4:
	> They then tell you that "snitches get stitches" so it appears that they were 
	entierly serious.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Sorry, I hate learning. I have somewhere else to be. (Exit)
	&r3a1:
		...Why?
	
	
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer looks perturbed. Apparently they get this question a lot.
	They're considering making a sign.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	> They gesture for you to follow them.
	&m1
	
###### MERGE POINT
m1:
	*hide*
	*txout*
	*txin*
	*wait .15*
	*setspeaker narrator*
	*show*
	> The Singer has taken you over to the npc_combine playpen.
	...there's a bunch of combine soldiers walking in place and falling over.
	&m2
	
###### CAMERA SHOULD IMPLY A FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE FOR NEXT BIT
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> They tell you to look at the things behind the glass.
	     camera change from looking at singer in fp, to display case in fp
	> Closer.
	*setfov 70*
	> Closer.
	&m3
	
m3:
	*setfov 50* *emitsound sound/physics/glass/glass_sheet_impact_soft3.wav" %%% *setfov 60* %%%%
	> Not that close.
	&m4
	
###### Back to third person perspective here.
	
m4:
	> The Singer beams at you. "Aren't they amazing???" they ask via tablet,
	as you watch one of the NPC's fall over and continue trying to execute their walk cycle.
	&m5
	
m5:
	> Apparently for as long as the cats have been stripping places along Voidway 66 for parts,
	the Singer has been dedicated to preserving at least one of every unique thing
	they find. The Mewseum has a whole extra pocket dimension full of stuff that's not cool
	enough to display.
	&m6
	
m6:
	> Seeing your unchanging expression, they sigh.
	"It didn't seem RIGHT to just destroy the hard work of everyone who helped make
	these places in the first place forever!!"
	&m7
	
m7:
	> Plus sometimes they find neat shit. Or food supplies. Imagine, they tell you,
	having the ability to clone your favorite snack on demand.
	&m8
	
m8:
	> THAT is the true, secret power of the Mewseum.
	&m9
	
m9:
	> Apparently they need to finish up the entry for that stuff you brought back,
	but they'd be happy to hand out later! *mark_seen*
