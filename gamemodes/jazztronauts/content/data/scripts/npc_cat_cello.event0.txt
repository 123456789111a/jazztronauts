###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	*show*
	> You seem to have taken a wrong turn on your way to the Mewseum...
	This looks vaguely like a hotel area. I guess the Bartender planned
	for thi- 
	&b1
	
b1:
	> ...Was that the Cellist? 
	&b2
	
b2:
	> You take a few steps further into the hallway to check on 
	the Cellist, but he staggers into view from around the corner. 
	He kinda smells like gunpowder.
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	okay so turns out gasoline has way more shit in it than just butane,
	and that soaking bud in crude oil does not in fact make hash that
	could give God couch lock, it just makes it explode when
	you try cooking it down
	&b4
	
b4:
	i suppose the adrenaline and endorphins secondary to getting
	tempered glass acupuncutre of the face counted as getting high
	though so I'm gonna chalk that one down as something to revisit.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		You seem remarkably unfazed by being blown up.
	&r1a1:
		Is this a regular occurance?
	&r2a1:
		Y'know that feels like something you could have figured out
		with common sense.
		
###### BRANCH 1 
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	look i'm at the forefront of researching new pharmaceutical 
	chemicals i am not a coward who is afraid to be on the 
	occasionally literally bleeding edge
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	its not like any infection can survive the gygaxian nightmare of
	toxins that have supplanted my immune system anyway so i can afford
	to not care about workplace safety. cross contamination adds that
	irreplaceable taste of surprise to every dose
	&m1
	
###### BRANCH 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	.......okay so are you actually blind or did you fail to notice the
	entierty of my existence in the visual spectrum serves to telegraph
	the fact that i jailbroke my factory standard self preservation
	instincts
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	like you know how people who grow up in the middle of nowhere get so
	bored they end up inventing new pastimes based entierly on saying
	"hey y'all watch this" before doing something that voids the 
	warranty on their limbs, organs, and/or skeleton
	&r2a3
	
r2a3:
	they have only taken the first step down that road to enlightenment.
	i've had a lot more time to practice.
	&m1
	
	
###### MERGE 1
m1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	but enough about me and my decidely singular life choices.
	let's talk about you for a bit. it takes a certain sort of weirdo
	to accept a job offer from a pack of weird cat gremlins from beyond
	time and space. why'd you agree to this arrangement?
	player:
	&exploration:
		To see the sights, explore all these places people made.
	&comraderie:
		I kinda wanted to get to know the four of you more.
	&agoodtime:
		I'mma get rich and mess with all your weird guns.
		
###### THE PLAYER WANTS TO EXPLORE AND SEE SIGHTS
exploration:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	yeah i get that. its fucking wacky how much there is out there right, 
	from whole worlds that are just tiny featureless cubes to somebody
	trying to make the world's most accurate representation of the
	intersection they used to live near
	&exp1
	
exp1:
	sixteen thousand vast and trunkless repos of maps
	standing in the desert
	&exp2
	
exp2:
	makes you wanna pick that shit apart don't it?
	make like bootleg indiana jones and really get up in them disasterpieces
	and rub your eyeballs all over their shitty nav meshes and
	broken textures.
	&exp3
	
exp3:
	or maybe you're the type who looks for the legends of the medium and
	studies all the little parlor tricks and clever implementations they had.
	or you just rip them apart hoping to find some sort of distilled 
	inspiration in all the pieces.
	&exp4
	
exp4:
	you'll have plenty of time to find what appeals to you.
	&n1
	
######THE PLAYER WANTS TO GET TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS
comraderie:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	yeah yeah pull the other one
	&comrad1
	
comrad1:
	...you're serious? huh. well in my case there's not much to tell, really.
	i like long walks on the beach after fropping DMR, waking up in a garbage
	can with a mostly uneaten bad of arby's, and finding new ways to 
	confuse and disappoint the people i care about.
	&comrad2
	
comrad2:
	you'll get to know the rest of the nerds here if you talk to 'em, they're 
	all starved for company. the Bartender's always willing to chat but you
	better enjoy the creeping sensation that you're being fucked with for
	her amusement 'cause boy howdy
	&comrad3
	
comrad3:
	the curmudgeonly ivory-tickling one with resting axe murderer face is 
	the Pianist. she's fun to fuck with but it's almost too easy these days.
	i'd say she's harmless but uh she super isn't so watch your mouth around
	her. or don't because that's way funnier.
	&comrad4
	
comrad4:
	the one with the snazzy coattails is the Singer. they're the heart of
	the crew, really. they run the Mewseum and seem to love doing so which
	confuses the hell out of me but hey, good for them, at least somebody
	takes care of all those weirdos we adopt.
	&n1
	
######### JUST HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME THANKS
agoodtime:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	ah, naked avarice and gleeful capriciousness. i see you are a person of
	culture. well you're gonna get plenty of opporunities to scratch both
	those itches let me tell you you're gonna be up to your eyeballs in
	fabulous riches and weird-ass tech
	&goodtime1
	
goodtime1:
	though i am obligated to note the fabulous riches we provide are not
	recognized as legal tender in any dimension, plane, level, game, or
	socioeconomic structure other than our own.
	which is to say we're basically giving you monopoly money we doodled over.
	&goodtime2
	
goodtime2:
	however the guns and tools and shit you can get with those fabulous 
	riches are all yours to mess with. do whatever the hell you want to
	the places you go to with them and if you somehow manage to take
	them with you when you leave you can go ahead and keep them
	&goodtime3
	
goodtime3:
	as long as you aint a dick and tell people where you got that sweet
	kit of course. 
	&goodtime4
	
goodtime4:
	i'll have you know i have a crack team of legal 
	ninjas held in cryostasis who are released only to deliver 
	injunctions to people who steal credit for fame or money.
	and then murder them.

	man you've had me talking so long i'm starting to drop off
	my buzz here gimme a sec to light this
	&n2
	
n2:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Cellist walks over to a bong, and instead of lighting it like
	a sane person, the entire bong bursts into flames.
	He huffs the smoke anyway and it appears to work.
	&n3
	
n3:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	ahh nothing like a good indica to-*setanim cat_cello pose_passedout*
	&n4
	
n4:
	> The Cellist, upon a moment's examination, proves to be passed out
	cold in a deep sleep, and not in fact dead from some sort of turbo
	aneurysm. You decide its best to let sleeping cats lie, 
	in this case. *mark_seen*
