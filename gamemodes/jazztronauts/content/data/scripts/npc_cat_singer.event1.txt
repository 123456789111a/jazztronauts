	> The Mewseum is quiet as usual.
	Except for the Singer, who is tapping away at their tablet in
	front of one of those dolls you got for them.
	&b1
	
b1:
	> You approach the Singer, but for once they don't immediately look up when
	you get close. In fact, they don't seem to have noticed your presence at all.
	You hunker down in front of them and wave.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer startles and nearly drops their tablet. After fumbling to catch it,

###### BRANCH 2 
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer claps, eyes shining with delight. Of course you can name them. They don't
	know why they didn't think of doing this before. They congratulate you on having the
	natural knack for Good Life Choices.
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	> They are absolutely going to go back and name the other ones.
	Fuck yeah.

###### GOOD ANSWER
goodanswer:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer claps their paws together and bounces. You're apparently a natrual at this.
	That's almost exactly what they would have entered! Except the name, they thing the doll
	looks more like an Amelia Cobbler, but they enjoy your choice too!
	&m1
	
###### HEY, NOT BAD
decentanswer:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> While not exactly what they had in mind, it's a very good start!
	They make some adjustments to your entry that describe the physical apperance of the doll,
	and give you a paws up for the description of its demeanor.

	the doll looks like. And also is claiming it's a medical device???? Which, It's super not.
	BUT!!!!!!! That was a very good first attempt!!!"
	&an2
	
an2:
	>They erase the part about Nannette being able to cure diseases and adds a description

	> The Singer thanks you for your help, you've given them some good ideas on how to
	make each entry individual, even if the item is virtually identical.

m2:
	> Before you leave, they pat your arm and pass your \$25 in exchange for your time
	and service!
