    like you’d think all you do is crack open a can of Bougie Beige and 
    do a zoom shot of a paint roller covering about three foot of wall and bam 
    you’re in an immaculately stenciled dining room with trim that changes color in different lighting

    like consider the phrasing of that shit you make an 
    entire standing structure of chopped and pressed plant corpses 
    and that shits still going hundreds of years after death, 
    literal physical intake of air as it expands and contracts,

    poured out meat mortar and if you listened real close at night 
    you could hear them beneath that thin skin of latex and oil

    countless death rattles stretched out into infinity in a single 
    monstrous chorus as the walls themselves pulse to the rhythm of a heart 
    they lost long ago, straining against color designed to be overlooked and forgotten
