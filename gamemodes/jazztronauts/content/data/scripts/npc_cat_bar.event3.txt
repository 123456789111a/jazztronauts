    told to serve up a drink made entirely of hot water and ice.

    >Actually, she’s somehow decanting steaming tap water from a faucet into a 
    normal drinking glass full of ice that stubbornly refuses to melt. 
    It’s impressive.

    Your hot water on the rocks, sir.

    momentarily looking annoyed, before regaining his smug expression and 
    chugging it in one go.

    ...after a few seconds of dead silence she gasps.

c2:
    Ah, of course! You meant to order it at a danger rating of Double Black 
    Diamond. I do warn you it may be beyond even your remarkable ability 
    to tolerate.

    >The Cellist is cut off by the sound of the Bartender slamming a pot 
    of hot water onto the Bar’s stove. She turns the temperature up to a 
    setting marked “reckless abandon,” and reaches for a bucket with a 
    warning label that reads “liquid nitrogen.”

    almost identical to being on fire. Or maybe more like that weird moment

    well played.
