###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	*show*
	>The Cellist appears to be ranting about something at the Pianist,
	who appears to be enjoying this about as much as someone cornered
	by Jehovah's Witnesses.

	in summary, when Meat Loaf sings about 'that' in I Would Do Anything For
	Love (But I Won't Do That), it should be readily apparent that he's referring
	to a set of statements that amount to being a callous or unfaithful lover, you fool.
	you impecile. you great ambulatory chode.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	That's fascinating, Cellist, but oh HEY PLAYERNAME wants to talk to you, 
	and man, i'm really into this conversation, but i'd hate to be so rude as 
	to take up all your time, so...
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist notices you gawking, and senses her chance to escape.
	player:
	&b4:
		Wait, wha-
	&b4:
		No wait I was just passing by-
	&b4:
		Don't you leave me along with him you rat fu-
		
b4:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	No need to thank me i'll be sure to petition Congress for 
	a posthumous Medal of Honor,
	now if you'll excuse me -
	&b5
	
b5:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist sprints out of the room past the player, leaving you and the Cellist.
	He watches her run off with a stoned, smug smile before turning to look at you.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Alright, alright. What's on your mind this time?
	&r2a1:
		Oh man uh, look at the time, I've got to, see a man, about a horse,
		that I left in my oven, that I left on?? (Exit)

###### BRANCH 2 EARLY EXIT

	*setspeaker narrator*
	>Trusting your flight or fight instincts, you adopt a runners pose and dead sprint
	in any direction that will let you not have this conversation.

###BRANCH 1
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	did anyone ever tell you that michelangelo's david is made of garbage
		camera cut here to the player with their blank face. hide and then show text bubble.
	it's true look it up i'll wait
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	...assuming you did you just saw that i'm right. assuming not, the statue that damn near
	half the planet considers one of the pinnacles of an art form was made of a big-ass
	chunk of flawed marnle that was just sorta laying around outside because it was shitty
	&r1a3
	
r1a3:
	there's something profound to say in there somewhere but i
	am too inebriated to bother trying.
	&r1a4
	
r1a4:
	michelangelo did way more interesting things than a jumbo size statue of a dude with
	big hands and a wee bepis though, like that time he painted a picture of a critic burning
	in hell so sick it became a world renowned tourist attraction
	player:
	&owntheplayer:
		I'm assuming you mean the Tomb of Pope Julius II.
	&actualanswer:
		I'm assuming you mean the Sistine Chapel.
	&owntheplayer:
		I'm assuming you mean the Cappella Paolina.
	&fairenough:
		I have no early idea what you're talking about.
		
###### INCORRECT ANSWER

	>The Cellist looks smug.
	&own1
	
own1:
	haha you were just picking on of those options at random and hoping you were right
	weren't you
	&own2
	
own2:
	or maybe you took an art history course one semester and were too busy doing rails of
	white lightning in the janitor's closet to remember the names of every frat house in italy
	that has the same sort of priceless cultural artifact or another
	&m1
	
###### ACTUAL ANSWER
actualanswer:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	>The Cellist raises an eyebrow.

actual1:
	either you're an art history geek, surprisingly versed in bullshit-fu, or lucky,
	but yeah
	&m1
	
###### YEAH FAIR ENOUGH DUDE
fairenough:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	y'know what thank you, it's refreshing to have someone just fucking say that for once
	instead of trying to bullshit their way through a topic they know 
	absolutely nothing about.
	&fair1
	
fair1:
	said the gigantic hypocritical asshole of course but hey pobody's nerfect
	&m1
	
	
###### MERGE POINT
m1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	so anyone who's so much as seen a single meme knows what the big important 
	paintings on the ceiling of the sistine chapel look like right, but it takes a 
	certain kind of dork to remember the other thing micehalangelo did in there
	&m2
	
m2:
	big ol portrait of the end times with ya boy Jesus up top conducting the show with
	a torso built like a goddamn tree trunk, like homeboy skipped both arm and leg day
	and just did crunches 24/7 after blasting off into space on the 40th day
	&m3
	
m3:
	now it is entierly possible to go on a big ol diatribe about the composition and the
	use of color and the narratives created by the way the figures are arranged and 
	drawing your eye around in a certain order
	&m4
	
m4:
	but that's something you can get out of any given stolen college textbook
	&m5
	
m5:
	and is way less funny than talking about all the people who got super mad
	that mike drew a bunch of butts on a church wall

	>The Cellist hits the blunt he's holding
	&m6
	
m6:
	see this dude biagio da cesena, the emcee for the pope (which may be the best job
	title to ever put on your resume), saw that mike painted everybody's immortal souls
	as naked people and got his jorts in a twist over it
	&m7
	
m7:
	said it was the sort of thing that belonged in bathhouses and taverns rather than
	a church, which reads like a ringing endorsement to me but what do i know
	&m8
	
m8:
	in reponse mike painted him in as the pagan judge of the dead, gave him donkey ears
	to show he was a dumb jackass, and graciously covered his nudity with a snake
	chewing on his dick
	player:
	&r3a1:
		That rules.
	&r4a1:
		How did Michelangelo get away with that?
	&r5a1:
		So why did nobody get mad at Adam being naked on the ceiling?
		
###### BRANCH 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	hell yeah it does.
	&n1
	
###### BRANCH 4
r4a1:
	well biggie bitched at the pope about it but the pope roasted his nuts by saying he
	didn't have the jurisdiction to bail souls out of hell so he'd have to stay there
	in the painting
	&r4a2
	
r4a2:
	they painted clothes on everybody after mike bit it though because
	they were cowards
	&n1
	
	
###### BRANCH 5
r5a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	well you need to understand that for a very long period of time european art had a
	strict divide between the concept of 'nude' and 'naked'
	&r5a2
	
r5a2:
	'nude' referred to people imitating the greco-roman style of the idealized human
	form presented without clothing for its aesthetic value, while 'naked' referred to
	actually potraying a real person like they were anything but a controlled object
	&r5a3
	
r5a3:
	it thus was seen as a terrible horrible no good very bad thing that had nothing to 
	do with the fact that it was usually done as a direct critique of contemporary art
	and society, or that it gave a lot of people shameful boners.
	&n1
	
###### MERGE POINT 2
n1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	art is always most interesting when it's basically just extremely high elaborate
	high concept trolling is what im getting at. the french mastered that shit.
	they had dudes ripping urinals off walls to display, painting prostitutes
	as venus, the works
	&n2

n2:
	the more elaborate and uptight and demanding a creative form is the more fun it
	is when someone uses those rules to make a gigantic middle finger to gatekeeping
	pricks. or just throws a brick in their window. 
	both work.
	&n3
	
n3:
	>The Cellist hits his blunt again.
	&n4
	
n4:
	i suppose i've trapped you in a corner and rambled at you about stupid shit long
	enough. you can knock off if you'd like.
	&n5
	
n5:
	but, hey, if you ever want to get high and talk about this sort of shit again?
	you know where to find me. *mark_seen*
