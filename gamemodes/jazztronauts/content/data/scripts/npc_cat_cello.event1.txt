	>The Cellist is sprawled out in a booth. He looks down for the 
	count. In front of him, is a shot glass that appears to be 
	All Colors.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The glass looks like somebody distilled both the visuals of,
	and all of the illicit substances at, a Pink Floyd laser light show.
	Must be the Good Shit.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	>The Cellist opens his eyes blearily.
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	alright if you aren't some sort of phantasmal horror waiting to shapeshift
	into one of my innermost fears to torment me in the liminal space between
	consciousness and death, idk, stare blankly or something.
	&b4
	
b4:
	*hide .1*
	camera cut to the players blank ass face here
	*show .1*
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	that's the spirit

b5:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	now that i have established it is in fact you i'm talking to and not one of
	my many hallucinatory ghosts of once and future christmas, i've been meaning
	to tell you that i appreciate your work getting me the ingredients for the
	Good Shit together.
	&b6
	
b6:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i'm not sure what was in that gasoline, or that beer for that matter,
	but god damn if this isn't the best batch i've had in a while. maybe it was
	"essence of subcontracted manual labor"
	&b7
	
b7:
	but i digress.
	i've been meaning to give you a reward more substantial than arbitrary
	anarcho-corporate scrip. Namely,
	
	>The Cellist pushes the glass across the table twoards you...
	&b8
	
b8:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	if you're interested you can take a sip of the fruit of your labor.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		What else is in there, exactly?
	&r2a1:
		What does it do?
	&r3a1:
		(SLAM THAT SHIT)
	&r4a1:
		I appreciate it but while I love dying and being dead I'm making
		and exception here. (exit)

r4a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	s'aright. suit yourself.
	
	...what?
	&r4a2
	
r4a2:
	you expected me to make a scene over that? naw man, this shit ain't D.A.R.E.
	unless you're as much of a trainwreck as me it's entierly reasonable to look
	at a glass that looks like some sort of fourth dimensional clown tears and go
	fuck that shit i'm out.
	&r4a3
	
r4a3:
	i mean it leaves more for me too but that's secondary, i swear.
	
	y'all have a nice day now.
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 1
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	okay i'll be real with you. much like sausage, politics, and legacy codebases,
	you're gonna be way happier not knowing.
	player:
	&r2a1:
		What does it do?
	&r3a1:
		(SLAM THAT SHIT)

###### BRANCH 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	uhhh. yo ever read one of those articles where it's a trip report of some
	dumb motherfucker who took like fifteen things at irresponsible doses and
	like a couple of them weren't even drugs
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	start there and think bigger, if you drank that whole glass.
	one sip should be a little more manageable.
	maybe.
	player:

###### BRANCH 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The next segment is designed to be as visually awful to look at, on purpose.
	If you get motion sickness, epilepsy, or any other conditions to view, you
	may safely skip it.
	player:
	&placeholder:
		Yes, I would like to skip the trippy visuals.
	&m1:
		No, i'm here to get FUCKED UP responsibly.
	
###### MERGE POINT

m1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>You take the glass and down it. Kinda burns like tequila.
	
	...nothing's happened yet.
	player:
	&m2:
		So how long does this take to do anything?
		
m2:
	insert slam cut to weird trippy visuals here, setcam to a part of the map
	that is Just Void or something. after playing in the space this shows up,

	i mean, not that I expected that to kill you, of course, but uh,
	that hit you pretty hard. i wasn't sure you were ever gonna get up.
	not many people do.
	&m7
	
m7:
	you... you have potential. the potential to make horrifying life choices
	with relative impunity. sit at my feet, and i will show you a world that
	you should never visit, because i am not an example for anybody.
