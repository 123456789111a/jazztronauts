	>The Cellist is sprawled out in a booth. He looks down for the 
	count. In front of him, is a shot glass that appears to be 
	Every Color.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The glass looks like somebody distilled both the visuals of,
	and all of the illicit substances at, a Pink Floyd laser light show.
	Must be the Good Shit.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	>The Cellist opens his eyes blearily.
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	alright if you aren't some sort of phantasmal horror waiting to shapeshift
	into one of my innermost fears to torment me in the liminal space between
	consciousness and death, idk, stare blankly or something.
	&b4
	
b4:
	*hide .1*
	camera cut to the players blank ass face here
	*show .1*
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	that's the spirit

b5:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	now that i have established it is in fact you i'm talking to and not one of
	my many hallucinatory ghosts of the once and future christmas, i've been 
	meaning to tell you that i appreciate your work getting me the ingredients 
	for the Good Shit together.
	&b6
	
b6:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i'm not sure what was in that gasoline, or that beer for that matter,
	but god damn if this isn't the best batch i've had in a while. maybe it was
	"essence of subcontracted manual labor"
	&b7
	
b7:
	but i digress.
	i've been meaning to give you a reward more substantial than arbitrary
	anarcho-corporate scrip. Namely,
	
	>The Cellist pushes the glass across the table towards you.
	&b8
	
b8:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	if you're interested you can take a sip of the fruit of your labor.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		What else is in there, exactly?
	&r2a1:
		What does it do?
	&r3a1:
		(SLAM THAT SHIT)
	&r4a1:
		I'm going to need to come back considerably more prepared to handle that stuff. (exit)
	&r5a1:
		Listen, I appreciate the offer, but I don't go for that sort of thing. (exit and complete)

###### BRANCH 4

r4a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	wise move. i'll be here psychically hollering at the anubis until you need me
	&exit
		
###### BRANCH 5 EARLY COMPLETION FOR PEOPLE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF CASUAL EXTREME TURBO DRUG USE
r5a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	s'aright. suit yourself.
	
	...what?
	&r5a2
	
r5a2:
	you expected me to make a scene over that? naw man, this shit ain't D.A.R.E.
	unless you're as much of a trainwreck as me it's entirely reasonable to look
	at a glass that looks like some sort of fourth dimensional clown tears and go
	fuck that shit i'm out.
	&r5a3
	
r5a3:
	i mean it leaves more for me too but that's secondary, i swear.
	
	y'all have a nice day now.*mark_seen*
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 1
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	okay i'll be real with you. much like sausage, politics, and legacy codebases,
	you're gonna be way happier not knowing.
	player:
	&r2a1:
		What does it do?
	&r3a1:
		(SLAM THAT SHIT)

###### BRANCH 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	uhhh. you ever read one of those articles where it's a trip report of some
	dumb motherfucker who took like fifteen things at irresponsible doses and
	like a couple of them weren't even drugs
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	start there and think bigger, if you drank a whole glass.
	one sip should be a little more manageable.

	maybe.

###### BRANCH 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The next segment is designed to be visually awful to look at, on purpose.
	If you get motion sickness, epilepsy, or any other condition triggered 
	similarly, you may safely skip it.
	player:
	&placeholder:
		Yes, I would like to skip the trippy visuals.
	&m1:
		No, i'm here to get FUCKED UP responsibly.
	
###### MERGE POINT

m1:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>You down the shot of the Good Shit. It tastes like someone fermented all
	the different syrups in a soda machine and mixed them into a shot.
	
	...nothing's happened yet.
	player:
	&m2:
		So how long does this take to do anything?
		
m2:
	insert slam cut to weird trippy visuals here, setcam to a part of the map
	that is Just Void or something. after playing in the space this shows up,

m6:
	i mean from all the screaming i was figuring we were looking at a two or
	three day long adventure that'd end with you getting sober and realizing
	you bought a grand piano off ebay but that was only a few hours
	&m7
	
m7:
	you... you have potential. the potential to make horrifying life choices
	with relative impunity. sit at my feet, and i will show you a world that
	you should never visit, because i am not an example for anybody.
