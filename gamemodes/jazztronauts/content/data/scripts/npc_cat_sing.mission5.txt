###### singer and pianist are sitting together

accept:
	> The Singer waves you over as usual and the Pianist cracks open an eye to 
	look you up and down before returning to her meditation. The Singer sticks
	their tongue out at her and passes over the tablet with your 
	mission brief\:
	&a1
	
a1:
	> This one is a bit weird even by the standard you've come to expect\:
	"Hey so this is the last thing I need to finally test a theory I've been developing
	for actual years!!!! If you can get me NUMBER radio's, I should be able to make
	some motherfucking magic happen. Hopefully. Maybe." *start 5*
	&a2
	
a2:
	> "We'll see together it'll be a journey of discovery \:･ﾟ✧\(\=✪ ᆺ ✪\=)/\:･ﾟ✧
	This is the last job I'll be able to give, so I'll be sure it's your biggest
	haul yet!!!"
	&a3
	
a3:
	> The Singer tells you that they've really enjoyed working with you and hope
	you'll stick around for a while, before settling in to meditate with 
	the Pianist.

	They're sleeping.
	You got The Goods yet?
	&i2
	
i2:
	Wait that was a stupid question, as you aren't toting the contents of an 
	ancient ass AV store on your person.
	&i3
	
i3:
	I don't know why they want you to rob grandpa's radioshack but I'm sure there's
	some lofty intellectual goal behind it. Whatever it is, thanks for helping them out.
	I haven't seen the Singer so excited for a really long time. They like everyone, but
	I think they really enjoy your company.
	&i4
	
i4:
	They;ll be sad when you leave.
	&Exit

turnin:
	> When the Singer sees you, they light up with joy. They're nearly vibrating with how
	fast they're bouncing. After handing over your pay of NUMBER, they take the radios
	inside the Mewseum and gesture for you to follow. *finish 5*
	&t1
	
t1:
	> The Singer claps and goes around to each of the NPC's. They seem to be checking in
	with them somehow, but it's hard to tell exactly what they're doing. When they're
	satisfied, they trot over to stand beside you and pull out their tablet.
	&t2
	
t2:
	> They inform you that they're looking for any anomalous response, and have tried a
	variety of different enrichment activities to try and encourage this. Then, they press
	a button on their tablet.
	&t3
	
t3:
	sequence here of the singer blasting Que Chevere at an npc. they have no reaction.
	> The Singer's shoulders slump. 
	They turn away and start to open a door.

	*setspeaker narrator*
	this is a combine soldier talking\:
	Hey, can you turn that down? I have a headache.
	&t5
	
t5:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer nearly drops their tablet in shock, and immediately turns off the radios.
	They apologize to the NPC who spoke, and you both hurry out of the Mewseum.
	&t6
	
t6:
	> The Singer is actually crying with joy. They tell you that they will never be able to
	fully express how much you've helped them and their research out, and thanks to your help
	they're going to be able to fulfil a promise to an old friend. They'd like to talk later,
	if you have the time.
