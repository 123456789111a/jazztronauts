    So now that we have a moment,%%%*setskin 1* how are you settling in?%%
    *setskin 0*We have very little idea of how to provide creature comforts,%
    but I'm told that the camp has a %%"cozy"%% quality these days.
    player:
	&resp1a:
		It's uh...yeah, cozy's one word for it.%%
        Did you guys set up all the scrap metal walls and stuff?
	&resp2a:
		I'm more interested in that huge machine across from it.%
        Can you tell me more about it?
    &resp3a:
        Fine, thanks. Is it ok if I just unwind and reflect by myself? (Exit)

###### Branch 1
resp1a:
    *setskin 2*%%*setskin 0*No, that was not our handiwork.%
    The camp and the wash room next to it are %%*setskin 3*new additions%%%*setskin 0*. 
    The last group before you,% actually.%%*setskin 1* Lovely bunch.
    &resp1b

resp1b:
    Certainly raised a few eyebrows, %though.%% It's not often you see a-*setskin 3*%%%%
    Well.*setskin 0*%%% Hm.*setskin 2*%%%%*setskin 0* *setanim cat gesture_dryhands* I'm not sure this is my story to tell,% honestly.%%
    Forgive me,% I try not to gossip about my patrons.
    player:
    &resp1c:
        C'mon, man, you can't just drop that and not follow through.
    &resp1c:
        You can tell me, I'm not a cop.
    &resp1c:
        Drama, then?

resp1c:
    *setanim cat idle* **setskin 2*Like*setanim cat gesture_sweep 1.0 idle* I said, not my story to tell.%*setskin 0*
    It's not anything particularly scandalous,% just a silly thing 
    that I'd feel rather %%*setskin 1*catty%%*setskin 0* talking about behind their backs.
    &resp1d

resp1d:
    *setskin 1* *setanim cat gesture_foldarms* Honestly,% I don't think I've ever met such a cheery,% energetic bunch.
    They %clearly loved just spending time with each other%.%.%.
    didn't even seem to mind they were trapped here,%
    so long as they were enjoying themselves. 
    &resp1e

resp1e:
    *setskin 0*I admit,%% I've a great deal of respect for people like that.%%
    I hope the six of them are doing well for themselves,%

resp2a:
    The jury-rigged*setanim cat gesture_sweep 1.0 idle*  Combine machinery with a giant CRT connected 
    to it, I assume?%% *setskin 1*Yes,% it does stand out,%% doesn't it.
    &resp2b

resp2b:
    Sorry to say,*setskin 0*%*setanim cat gesture_dryhands* that was not our work.%%% In fact it wasn't any %ONE's%% work.%
    That has been a %very% long project.
    &resp2c

resp2c:
    *setskin 2**setanim cat gesture_sweep 1.0 idle* Back before we had it,%% we had to manually drive up and down 
    Voidway 66 trying to find a place to salvage,% hoping any 
    given wormhole would be worthwhile.
    &resp2d
resp2d:
    It was not optimal,*setanim cat gesture_foldarms*% to say the least.%%*setskin 1* Eventually a guest 
    had the idea to make a compass that pointed to the closest dimensional 
    breach.%%%%*setskin 0* I think a piece of it is still in that machine somewhere.
    &resp2e
    
resp2e:
    Then another guest wired some gizmo they had to it,%
    and then *setanim cat gesture_sweep 1.0 idle* another,%% and another,%% a little bit at a time%
    until we were left with that hulking mass out there.%%
    To be honest,%*setskin 3* I would not know how to repair it if we needed to.
    &resp2f
resp2f:
    So,*setskin 1*% try and be gentle with it.%%% It's got a long legacy.

    *setskin 0**setanim cat gesture_sweep 1.0 idle* In any event,%% it's come a long way from the empty room that it once was.%%

    the camp again does fill me with a sort of pride.
