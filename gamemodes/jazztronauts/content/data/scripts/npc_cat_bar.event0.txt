    So now that we have a moment, how are you settling in?%%
    We have very little idea of how to provide creature comforts,%
    but I'm told that the camp has a %"cozy"% quality these days.
    player:
	&resp1a:
		It's uh...yeah, cozy's one word for it.%%
        Did you guys set up all the scrap metal walls and stuff?
	&resp2a:
		I'm more interested in that huge machine across from it.%
        Can you tell me more about it?
    &resp3a:
        Fine, thanks. Is it ok if I just unwind and reflect by myself? (Exit)

###### Branch 1
resp1a:
    No, that was not our handiwork.%
    The camp and the wash room next to it are new additions. 
    The last group before you,% actually.%% Lovely bunch.
    &resp1b

resp1b:
    Certainly raised a few eyebrows, %though.%% It's not often you see a-%%%%
    Well.%%% Hm.%%%% I'm not sure this is my story to tell,% honestly.%%
    Forgive me,% I try not to gossip about my patrons.
    player:
    &resp1c:
        C'mon, man, you can't just drop that and not follow through.
    &resp1c:
        You can tell me, I'm not a cop.
    &resp1c:
        Drama, then?

resp1c:
    Like I said, not my story to tell.%
    It's not anything particularly scandalous,% just a silly thing 
    that I'd feel rather catty talking about behind their backs.
    &resp1d

resp1d:
    Honestly,% I don't think I've ever met such a cheery, energetic bunch.
    They clearly loved just spending time with each other%.%.%.
    didn't even seem to mind they were trapped here,%
    so long as they were enjoying themselves. 
    &resp1e

resp1e:
    I admit, I've a great deal of respect for people like that.%%
    I hope the six of them are doing well for themselves,%
    wherever they are now.
    &merge1a

###### Branch 2
resp2a:
    The jury-rigged Combine machinery with a giant CRT connected 
    to it, I assume?%% Yes, it does stand out, doesn't it.
    &resp2b

resp2b:
    Sorry to say,% that was not our work.% In fact it wasn't any %ONE's% work.%
    That has been a very long project.
    &resp2c

resp2c:
    Back before we had it,% we had to manually drive up and down 
    Voidway 66 trying to find a place to salvage,% hoping any 
    given wormhole would be worthwhile.
    &resp2d
resp2d:
    It was not optimal,% to say the least.% Eventually a guest 
    had the idea to make a compass that pointed to the closest dimensional 
    breach.%% I think a piece of it is still in that machine somewhere.
    &resp2e
    
resp2e:
    Then another guest wired some gizmo they had to it,%
    and then another,% and another,% a little bit at a time%
    until we were left with that hulking mass out there.%%
    To be honest,% I would not know how to repair it if we needed to.
    &resp2f
resp2f:
    So, try and be gentle with it.%% It's got a long legacy.
    &merge1a

###### Branch 3
resp3a:
    Of course it is.% Please,% take as much time as you need,% 
    and let me know when you'd like a new drink.
    &exit

###### Merge point
merge1a:
    In any event,% it's come a long way from the empty room that it once was.%%
    I'll admit,% hearing laughter and commotion coming from 
    the camp again does fill me with a sort of pride. 
    &merge1b

merge1b:
    Perhaps it is the nature of my profession,% who can say?
    &merge1c
merge1c:
    I hope you will be comfortable here during your stay.%%
    Please,% don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything.
    %% Ah, one other thing.%.%.
    &merge1d
merge1d:
    This isn't required of you,% but can I ask you to spend some time 
    with the rest of my peers?%% They won't admit it,% but they do 
    enjoy the company%.%.%.and exposure to different worldviews 
    couldn't hurt them either.
    &merge1e
merge1e:
    Well then,% I think it's time I let you go back to your business.%%
    Thank you for coming,% and I hope you drop by again soon.
