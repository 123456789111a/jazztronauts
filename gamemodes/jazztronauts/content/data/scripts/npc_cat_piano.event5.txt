	Hey. Do you have a minute?
	I really. Want to talk.
	I need a personal favour.

	*setspeaker narrator*
	>This is the last Event in the Pianist's quest line.
	It may take you a while to watch, you can come back to it
	without penalty if you are in a hurry.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Hey, sorry this is a bad time. I'll be back later. (Exit)
	&r2a1:
		Maaaybe. If I'm not getting paid in hard cash though I'm gonna
		need to be paid in kind and that means you need to steal me like
		five trays of snickerdoodles.
	&r3a1:
		Sure.

###### Branch 1 EARLY EXIT		
r1a1:
	Oh! Sure.
	I'll uh. Still be here.

	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>She laughs, then taps her chin as if she's weighing up your
	demands for a moment.
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	Yeah, I can work with those terms and conditions. 
	Hell, I'll bake the things myself.
	&r2a3
	
r2a3:
	Wait.%%%%%% No.
	I can't bake and I'm banned from operating the oven anyway.
	I'll throw in the drink of your choice instead.
	So, are you in?
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Actually this is a bad time. I'll be back later. (Exit)
	&r3a1:
		Sure.

###### START	
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist takes you to a... custom level?
	It's sure something. The Pianist walks further into
	the room.
	&m2
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist sits on the edge of the plinth and kicks her legs 
	back and forth. After a good fifteen seconds she gets up and shrugs.
	&m3
	
m3:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	So.
	What do you think?
	I made this place myself.
	player:
	&r4a1:
		That thing in the ground. Is that a jellyfish or Art?
	&r5a1:
		It's uh. It's. Uh. Yeah.
	&r5a1:
		I can tell.
	
###### BRANCH 4 
r4a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>She blinks, and her face scrunches up like she just bit into something sour.
	&r4a2
	
r4a2:
	What? No. It's a piano.
	I mean, it's fucking terrible, which is why I just stole this one.
	     make pianist gesture in a direction that has real piano. maybe camera hold on it.
	&r4a3
	
r4a3:
	But I thought I got the shape mostly right!
	God. Fuck.
	What do you think of the rest?
	player:
	&r5a1:
		It's uh. It's. Uh. Yeah.
	&r5a1:
		I can definitely tell that you made all this.
		
###### BRANCH 5
r5a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>She crumples. Anger, frustration, and despair flash over her face before
	she buries it in her paws.
	&r5a2
	
r5a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	It's awful.
	You can say it, I know it is.
	&r5a3
	
r5a3:
	I do this every time. I try and learn some new skill because I can't do
	the one thing I'm actually good at anymore, and because I'm not 
	immediately Great at it I give up.
	&r5a4
	
r5a4:
	I guess I keep hoping there's a stack overflow level with self-loathing
	and the next time I try something I'll find the limiter's off and I can
	relax and create again.
	&r5a5
	
r5a5:
	This was the first thing I tried. After it happened. 
	I don't know if the Bartender told you or not, but ages ago something..
	Snapped. I can't play the piano anymore.
	&r5a6
	
r5a6:
	So I tried to make my own space where I could practice without feeling 
	like I was letting everyone down. 
	What use is a jazz Pianist who can't improvise?
	&r5a7
	
r5a7:
	It didn't fucking work. Scavenging made it worse. We went to so many
	places that were about as well put together as the Cellist's suit
	and I wanted to burn them to the ground.
	&r5a8
	
r5a8:
	I don't understand how people can make stuff like this-
	pianist gestures and then the camera holds on a section of the 
	map.
	&r5a9
	
r5a9:
	-and put it out into the world! Cluttering the universe with first drafts.
	It takes me weeks of practice before I can work up the confidence to show
	my friends and you've seen what happens. It's trash.
	It's all trash.
	&r5a10
	
r5a10:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I don't even know why I wanted to show you this.
	This is what happens when I don't plan shit.
	It's worthless.
	player:
	&n1:
		I'm glad you showed it to me anyway.
	&n1:
		The important thing is that you haven't stopped trying.
		
n1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Bringing you here was a mistake.
	I'm sorry I wasted your time.
	&n2
	
n2:
	>She goes silent for a long time, then slams her paw down on the keys.
	
	I might as well just give u-
	&n3

n3:
	>The Pianist stops mid work and stares down at her paw as the accidental
	chord resonantes through the room. Tears well and then spill unchecked
	down her cheeks as she hits the keys again.
	&n4
	
n4:
	> As you take a seat on the lone chair, she plays another chord, then another,
	and the brightest smile you've ever seen from her dawns on her face.
	&n5:
	
n5:
	this word bubble is probably gonna be entierly stage directions, and the pianist
	playing a song. at the end of the camera cuts and the song, show the following dialogue
	so the player knows to click to continue
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Right. That's why I brought you here.
	&n6
	
n6:
	Because I can't plan shit around you. Things just happen.
	
	Let's go back to the bar. I've got some good news for the others.
	&n7
	
n7:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	PLAYERNAME.
	Thank you for being my friend.
	player:
	&pianistconclude:
		Thanks for being mine.
		
&pianistconclude:
	>The two of you quietly head back the bar. *mark_seen*
