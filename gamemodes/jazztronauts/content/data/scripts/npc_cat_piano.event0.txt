###### START	
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Pianist and the Bartender are having a chat at the samsara...
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	-All I'm saying is, we'd probably get more customers through here if there was a 
	place to cut loose. Don't get me wrong I love the aesthetic we have but it's so...
	&b2
	
b2:
	...Serence.
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	An interesting proposal that I would entertain, if not for the fact that I know
	what your concept of "cutting loose" us.
	It's very difficult to get blood out of tile grout, you know.
	&b4
	
b4:
	>The Bartender notices you and waves, visibly relieved.
	&b5
	
b5:
	Ah, PLAYERNAME! Welcome, have a seat. Would you care for a snickerdoodle? I can-
	&b6
	
b6:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist slams her paw down on the bar and turns to face you, eyes narrowing.
	&b7
	
b7:
	You. Back me up here.
	This place would be infinitely more appealing if there was room for activities more
	stimulating than meditation or erudite conversation.
	&b8
	
b8:
	Something to get the blood pumpin.
	
	Like a coliseum.
	
	player:
	&r1a1:
		I prefer my blood pumping inside my body. 
		I'll take a snickerdoodle to go, though. (Exit)
	&r2a1:
		Okay, excellent suggestion, but hear me out here: Dance fighting.
		All of the thrill, none of the murder.
	&r3a1:
		If the floor is sand you don't need to worry about blood in the grout!
	
	
###### Branch 1 (early exit)
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist rolls her eyes.
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	Nobody appreciates my artistic vision. We've got the bread, we need the circus.
	History is on my side here.
	&r1a3
	
r1a3:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	>The Bartender pushes the plate of cookies over to you, beaming.
	&r1a4
	
r1a4:
	Thank you for your custom, PLAYERNAME.
	
	>She turns her attention back to the Pianist and puts a paw over her face.
	&r1a5
	
r1a5:
	Pianist. We've talked about this.
	
	Plenty of establishments manage to thrive without having a dedicated avenue for
	ritual combat. We have no need-
	&r1a6
	
r1a6:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>They resume normal conversation. You decide to grab your cookies and bounce.
	*mark_seen*
	&exit
	
###### Branch 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist stares at you. Her head tilts to one side.
	Her blank expression makes it difficult to tell if she's thinking about your
	suggestion, or mapping out the optimal way to dismember you.
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	No.
	&r2a3
	
r2a3:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	I don't know, I find the idea quite charming. And there would be no need to build
	an additional venue to facilitate it. We have plenty of space!
	I could have the singer make us a nice banner, put out some pamphlets...
	&r2a4
	
r2a4:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I cannot believe you're taking this seriously.
	&r2a5
	
r2a5:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	>The Bartender appears to be in deep thought. She claps, brightening.
	&r2a6
	
r2a6:
	Oh! We could let the clintele vote on the theme.
	Community participation!
	&r2a7
	
r2a7:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	>The Pianist slams her head on the bar.
	
	...it was pretty loud too...
	&r2a8
	
r2a8:
	I'm going to die.
	You're going to find me one day under a table with a little epitaph carved into 
	the blade of the axe you won't let me use. And all it'll say is "Here lies the 
	Pianist. Died of boredom"
	&m1
	
###### Branch 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	See!
	Now we're cooking with gas.
	This one gets it.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	Nice sand floor, elevated seats to reduce the chance of being slapped in the
	face by a stray hand... pretzels...
	&r3a3
	
r3a3:
	We'd finally have a fuckin' use for all the Singer's toys, too.
	It's genius.
	&r3a4
	
r3a4:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Sand gets everywhere, Pianist. I know you're excited, but you have to think about
	the practical consequences of these things. Do you really want to have to spend
	five hours trying to get all the viscera soaked grit out of your fur?
	&r3a5
	
r3a5:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Yes.
	&m1
	
	
###### MERGE BACK TO COMMON ROUTE
m1:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	...I'm sorry, but i'm afraid I will have to continue to veto the idea of a coliseum.
	For one thing, all ethical concerns aside, trying to get planning permission for
	that sort of thing would be an unending nightmare.
	&m2
	
m2:
	And for the other concern, I can't help but fell you would end up... killing all
	of our customers.
	
	Am I wrong?
	&m3
	
m3:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	...No.
	&m4
	
m4:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	I didn't think so. 
	
	I know it's a chore, but you'll have to find some 
	other way to entertain yourself.
	&m5
	
m5:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Fine.
	&m6
	
m6:
	>The Pianist knocks back the rest of her drink.
	Then she grabs a pawful of snickerdoodles and stalks off.
	&m7
	
m7:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	>The Bartender turns her attention back to you, and smiles.
	&m8
	
m8:
	Now, what can I get you?
