*setspeaker cat_bar*
Oh come now, they were perfectly fine. Besides we got a bargain 
on them, didn't we?
Take five, get one free!

*setspeaker narrator*
>The Cellist and Pianist both turn from scowling at each other, 
to glaring at the Bartender. Before the argument can go anywhere,
the silent cat starts waving their arms around.
