###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Bar Samsara... somber as usual.       %%%%%%%%%%%...?%%%
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> You see the Singer en route back to the Mewseum and head over to say hi.
	When they notice you, their tail puffs and they whip the little dino plush
	behind their back.
	&b2
	
b2:
	> They seem very interested in the floor suddenly.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		If you don't want me to see it, that's cool.
		See you later, yeah? (exit)
	&r2a1:
		Oh shit was that a brontosaurus? I love bronto's.
	&r3a1:
		It's okay, I'm not gonna give you shit or anything.

r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> They smile, and nod. You watch them leave with a spring in their step, and they
	don't bother trying to hide the dino as they do.
	&exit
	

###### BRANCH 2 
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Hesitantly, they nod, and take out their tablet. They possess a great deal of
	admiration for the humble brontosaurus. It's their favourite dinosaur.
	&r2a2

r2a2:
	> Seemingly delighted that you're still listening, they tell you that the name
	has been an intense source of drama in palentologist circles.
	&r2a3
	
r2a3:
	> Apparently the guy who discovered them found a second set of bones after naming
	the new thing the Apatosaurus, Assumed this second set was a new species of even
	BIGGER dinosaurs, Then they thought that wasn't true for a while and then it was
	and then not again???
	&r2a4
	
r2a4:
	> The Singer beams. "Now it's a GENUS rather than just one species so there's like
	three dinosaurs that get the subtitle of THUNDER LIZARD!!!! How fucking rad 
	is that???? (≈✪ᆽ✪≈)♡” 
	&r2a5
	
r2a5:
	> They seem a little less self-conscious now.
	&r1a1:
		If you don't want me to see it, that's cool.
		See you later, yeah? (exit)
	&r3a1:
		It's okay, I'm not gonna give you shit or anything.
	
###### BRANCH 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Slowly, they pull the plush out from behind their back.
	close up shot of dino toy
	> It's fucking adorable.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	>Tucking the brontosaurus under their arm, the Singer tells you that it was a 
	gift from one of the six people that stayed here before you did.
	&r3a3
	
r3a3:
	> They were a dear friend.
	&r3a4
	
r3a4:
	> It has a lot of sentimental value, but is no substitute for their company\:
	"It gets sort of lonely around here sometimes. And taking care of the Mewseum
	it much more work when it's jsut me (=^._.^=)” 
	&r3a5
	
r3a5:
	> The Singer stares off into the distance for a moment and then visibly snaps
	themselves out of it to smile at you. They tell you that they really appreciate
	the help you've been giving them so far and that it's been nice to have time
	to catalogue properly.
	&r3a6

r3a6:
	> They let you touch the bronto plushie.
	&r3a7
	
r3a7:
	> It's so fucking soft holy shit.
	&r3a8
	
r3a7:
	> The Singer bounces and tells you they'll have more work for you later but
	for now they've really gotta catch some Z's.
	&end
	
end:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Singer yawns, and jumps onto the top of the bar. They curl up
	with the dino plush and zonk out pretty quick. 
	You decide to head back. *mark_seen*
