CHARACTER = Eclipse Cat
begin:
     I am not happy.
     &a1
	
a1:
     I was supposed to be happy. 
     &a2
	
a2:
     I was supposed to be proud.  
     &a3
	
a3:
     
     I did so much.
     For so long.
     &a4
	
a4:
     It meant nothing. 
     &a5

a5:
     Nothing.
     player:
          &a6: What did you do?
          &a6: Are you okay?
          &a6: Why didn't I steal any fucking holy water...?
a6:
     I want it to stop.
     &a7
a7:
     So I’m going to make it stop. 
     &a8
a8:
     I’ve done it before.
     &a9
a9:
     It’s satisfying. 
     &a10
a10:
     For a moment.
     &a11
a11:
     You’ve done it before. It’s how you got here.
     &a12
a12:
     Help me.
     &a13
a13:
     It will stop. Forever.
     &a14
a14:
     It will be perfect.
     player:
          &badend: Sure, why not?
          &badend2: I refuse.
          &trueend: I propose a third option. (CALL THE TROLLEY)
       

### BAD END BOOGIE

badend2: 

     Useless.
     &badend

&badend:
     It will all be perfect.
     &exit

##cinematic stuff goes here, maybe the void cat throws you physically into the Last Shard or something if you didnt co-operate, boot player to waiting room


### TRUE END TRUFFLE SHUFFLE

trueend:
    I do not understand.
    &t1

The trolley hurtles through the void/wall/offscreen and smacks into the eclipse cat with the cow catcher, 
sends them hurtling out of view. Bartender is driving, Singer’s hanging out of the window, Pianist dangles out of the door 
and stares in direction the eclipse cat was flung. If we can give the Pianist A Gun that’d be rad, if not that’s fine. 
Cellist dangles out the other side of the door and has his hand outstretched


t1:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     MOVE. GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR AND GET ON THE TROLLEY!
     &t2

t2:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     c’mon buddy we ain’t got all day and i am not dying before 
     i find out the wu tang secret
     &t3

t3:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     BOSS IT’S TIME TO GO THAT THING IS BEING WEIRD AND I DIDN’T 
     HAVE TIME TO GRAB THE FLAMETHROWER.
     &t4

Cut to the eclipse cat floating in the void, some kind of messed up vfx of it maybe stretching and distorting like 
when a model gets all fucked up by twisting in ways it shouldn’t. Bartender reverses out of the hole she made and does a
sick u-turn on the narrow strip of voidway track. The void should be all fucked up, maybe with the red shard effect? 
As the trolley starts to go, everything gets shaky and the road starts to crack up.

t4:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     Please fasten your seatbelt, shit may be about to get mildly messy. 
     &t5


Aaand the road gibs. Trolley starts to fall into the void, shot of the eclipse cat directly overhead flipping its shit.

t5:
    *setspeaker cat_eclipse*
    Why Why Why WHy WHY yhW hWy hHYYhhHYh
     &t6

[Pianist and Cellist kinda hanging out of the door, Singer pulling on their sleeves to try and drag them back in. 
Shot from the side maybe as the trolley gracefully swandives into the void for a few seconds, cut back to eclipse cat, 
which stops freaking out and resolves into Ash. Ash dives after them, paw outstretched]


t6:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     We’ve got a pursuer!
     &t7

t7:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     I think you mean a purrsuer.
     &t8

t8:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     oh my god fuck you now is not the time for-
     &t9

[Ash dives past the trolley and grabs onto the cow catcher. Track appears and starts unfolding in front of them. 
The void slowly fades back to its normal state as the trolley evens out onto a flat path. If possible, have 
the cats t-posing in the void be Ash.]


t9:
     *setspeaker cat_ash*
     I do apologize for all the mess and inconvenience. 
     I’ve made a route back to your bar. 
     &t10

[Shot of literally everyone in the trolley just like :I except the Bartender, who looks delighted/awed]


t10:
     *setspeaker cat_singer*
     > The Singer holds up their tablet. They spell out their feelings in 
     massive, glittering comic sans : “WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU???”
     &t10
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
t11:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     uh yeah not to look a gift horse in its fucked up mouth but i did not 
     live as incomprehensibly long as i have without being generally 
     suspicious of creepy-ass motherfuckers metamorphosing into mild 
     mannered benefactors
     &t11

t12:
     *cat_ash*
     I’m Ash. 
     &t13

[Ash hops down off the cow catcher onto the track beside the trolley. Waves. Turns around and starts walking back. 
Change view back to interior of trolley. Beat.]

t13:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Oh. Ohhh. 
     &t14

t14:
     Well, then. I expect we shall have a safe trip home.
     &t15

[All the other cats turn around to look at the bartender. Squint. Sit]

t14:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     So are we going to address the fact that you know them or?
     &t14b

t14b:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     I don’t know them. I know of them. Mainly via the extremely limited 
     documentation that they left behind with the machine, after creating 
     the Voidway. 
     &t15

t15:
     It read like a confession, of sorts. An artisan who finished their 
     great work and found it did not confer the lifelong joy they expected. 
     &t16

t16:   
     From what I could tell from their frantic diary keeping, they felt 
     stuck in a stasis of sorts.
     &t17

t17:
     They feared attempting to create anything new, lest it fall short of 
     their previous achievement, and wrestled constantly with the desire 
     to destroy what they had made so they could feel free again.
     &t18

[Bartender looking pretty actually sad]   

t18:
     I thought it broke them. 
     Maybe it did.
     &t19
[The cats all look solemn. Pianist looks actively pained. Trolley pulls in to bar]

t19:
     Now, is everyone alright? All limbs intact? 
     &t20
[Cats nod, Bartender claps and smiles]

t20:
     Then I think a celebration is due, don’t you?
     &t21

t21:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     It’s not often something scares the shit out of me, so, yes a 
     “thank fuck we’re alive” party sounds ideal. 
     &t22

[cut to the Cellist with a smear of white powder under his nose, with his pupils expanded to fill almost the entire white of his eyes]

t22:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     sorry did you say something i was too busy attempting to erase 
     the memory of that sudden caress from the reaper’s bony fingers 
     by chemically carpet bombing what remains of my fear of death
     &t23

[Cut to player model for Judging Silence]

t23:
     look i will make an attempt to stick to standard and known forms 
     of mind altering substances and do no more than fifty (50) doses 
     in a day but i’m gonna be real me and sobriety are gonna have to 
     dance an extended tango before i know if we’re gonna be a good fit
     &t24

t25:
     *setspeaker cat_singer*
     > The Singer is delighted by the prospect of a party and announces 
     they will be bringing guests.
     &t26

[fade to black]

t27:
     *setspeaker narrator*
     > The next few hours are a blur. You sit on a barstool contemplating 
     the wall and your time here as the cats and NPCs rush around getting 
     the place jazzed up. The clink of glass on the bar gets your attention.
     &t28

[Fade back. Ideal Goals is for the place to look festive via many npc’s being present and mingling, 
many plates of those cookie and drink assets out. Pianist and Cellist laughing together with beverages 
off to the side, Singer bouncing next to their assistant metrocop. The trolley pulls up and another metrocop 
gets out. The Singer sprints over and drags them back to meet the other one, paws flapping. Focus on the glass 
on the bar in front of the player and the Bartender looking at them with a Thoughtful expression]

t29:
     *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Are you okay, <playername>? That was a close call back there.
     player:
     &r1: I've had urges like what the eclipse did to Ash. They scare me.
     &r2: Do you ever worry about getting stuck in a rut, like Ash talked about?
     &r3: Thanks for coming to get me.

###RESPONSE 1

r1:
     
     The urge to clear the canvas is seductive. It’s quick, easy, and 
     cathartic in the moment. I understand.
     &r1a

[Serious face]

r1a:
     But you should always try to remember that you’ll never know what 
     you or your work could mean to other people unless you keep it. 
     Unless you share it. 
     player:
     &r2: Do you ever worry about getting stuck in a rut, like Ash talked about?
     &r3: Thanks for coming to get me.
     &t30: I think the Pianist wants to talk to us...? (continue)

###RESPONSE 2

r2:
     Oh my, yes. Every day. Look around you. 
     &r2a

     [Pan around party, return]
r2a:
     The Bar Samara is my opus. I had no true purpose before we built this 
     place around a forgotten tool in the Voidway. It has honestly changed my 
     life.
     &r2b

r2b:
     We poured our hearts into this place. I do every time I step behind this bar. 
     &r2c

r2c:
     I often wonder whether I am already in a rut, and simply haven’t noticed yet. 
     If these days of quiet contentment will be a thing I resent in time for 
     ‘robbing’ me of time spent working on some other project.  
     &r2d

r2d:
     But so long as you are working toward happiness, no time is wasted. 
     &r2e

r2e:
     And I am happy. Not all the time, I have bad days like anyone. 
     &r2f

r2f:  
     But the satisfaction in a display arranged just so? 
     &r2g

r2g:
     That, for me, for now, is happiness. And should that change, 
     I shall seek a different engagement.
     player:
     &r1: I've had urges like what the eclipse did to Ash. They scare me.
     &r3: Thanks for coming to get me.
     &t30: I think the Pianist wants to talk to us...? (continue)

###RESPONSE 3

[Shocked expression resolving into chill]

r3:
     A host who does not ensure the welfare of her honoured guests 
     is a poor one indeed. 
     &r3a
r3a:
     More than that, we’d have been awful friends if we just sat 
     on our paws and stayed home.
     &r3b

r3b:
     We were united in determination to get you out of there, 
     and so, we did.
     player:
     &r1: I've had urges like what the eclipse did to Ash. They scare me.
     &r2: Do you ever worry about getting stuck in a rut, like Ash talked about?
     &t30: I think the Pianist wants to talk to us...? (continue)

### MERGE POINT

t30:
     *setspeaker cat_piano*
     Hey, we were talking and we want to do something to show our appreciation 
     for everything you’ve done. Before you head off. 
     &t31

t31:
     *setspeaker cat_cello*
     yeah everyone’s got their own path to walk and you’re welcome to hang 
     as long as you want but uh

     we kinda can’t pay you any more
     &t32

[The Singer nods sadly.]

t32:
     *setspeaker cat_singer*
     > The Singer holds up their tablet: “We’re settling down into this 
     business full time!!! Going legit. And thanks to your help with my 
     research, I’ve figured out how to keep us fully supplied without 
     needing to scavenge (=✪ᆽ✪=)”
     &t33

t33:
    *setspeaker cat_cello*
    which is real fucking handy because some narc snitched on the bortles
    so the space cops busted their gig and they were our go-between to
    our fence so we cant move anything til they post bail
    &t34

t34:
    *setspeaker cat_pianist*
    Oh and, uh, I dragged the piano out. You down for an impromptu 
    concert, boss?
    &t35

t35:
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
    Nothing would make me happier.
    &exit

[And scene. Credits roll, the cats are performing the title song [or something more fitting]. When it’s over, cut back to the bar.]
