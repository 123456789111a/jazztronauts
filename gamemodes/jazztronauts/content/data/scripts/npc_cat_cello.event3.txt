	oh, don't mind me, i was just spacing out.
	old memories.

	player:
	&m1:
		I was thinking of coming to take you up on that

	&r2a1:
		I was gonna chat, but if you're not up for it,
		I can just sit with you for a while.

r2a2:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i appreciate the sentiment, but i ain't one for sitting around awkwardly
	starin' at somebody. you wanna hang out it's gonna be easier for me if
	we talk, capiche?
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Sure, no problem. 
		So long as you're cool with it.

###### MERGE POINT
m1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	let's see, what's been on my mind lately...i mean, 
	aside from the drugs, those are a given.
	&m2
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	...Caravaggio.
	&m3
	
m3:
	y'see last time we spent entirely too much time on artists who were
	mostly functional people and that's erasure of complete disasters
	who happen to be extremely skilled in their chosen field, also
	known as my kind of people
	&m4
	
m4:
	and boy fucking howdy was caravaggio supreme fuckmaster of being just
	an absolute catastrophe, like even his first biographers were like
	damn this dude didn't have issues he had periodicals
	&m5
	
m5:
	now granted since these were old biographies of a famous guy who
	also did a whole lot of crimes they're also full of blatant lies
	and unprovable assertions so most of what we know about the guy
	needs to be taken with a pinch of salt
	&m6
	
m6:
	but like one of the hard facts we do have is that caravaggio had
	a criminal record that included committing manslaughter over a love
	triangle where the other two corners were a prostitute and her pimp
	so it's not hard to believe he was a bit of a character.
	player:
	&m7:
		What else was on the guy's rap sheet?
		
m7:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	oh jeez where to even start. petty theft, told a cop to shove a 
	dagger up their ass, allegedly murdered another cop, constantly
	started arguments that escalated into public brawls, carried a 
	sword around in public daring people to start shit...
	&m8
	
m8:
	...argued with clergy over proper portrayal of religious figures,
	showed the apostles and the virgin mary as incredibly improverished
	people as a pointed political statement when the church started 
	getting shitty about poor people after the counter-reformation...
	&m9
	
m9:
	...hung around with criminals and prostitutes, hired said prostitutes
	to model for his paintings to abuse a legal loophole, fucked those
	prostitutes while on the clock for said paintings, eventually 
	murdered a dude over one of those prostitutes...
	&m10
	
m10:
	...unproven but believable assertions he slept with men (which was 
	illegal for some reason???), painted the man he probably fucked as
	cupid, made a poem that called a rival who accused him of sodomy
	the equivalent of Johnny Ballsack in italian...
	&m11
	
m11:
	...beat the shit out of a waiter who gave him artichokes with butter
	instead of oil, took a shit on the doorstep of his landlord when she
	changed his locks, fled the country when charged with murder, joined
	a holy order to get a papal pardon for murder...
	&m12
	
m12:
	...attempted to kill one of the members of that holy order with a 
	pistol over an argument the day before he would have been included,
	got thrown out of the order after busting out of their prison,
	got arrested for forged papers, and died mysteriously after that.
	player:
	&m13:
		Holy shit.
		
m13:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	i consider him to be #goals tbh
	player:
	&r3a1:
		What's up with that "died mysteriously" part?
	&r4a1:
		How did this guy have any time to do art?
		
###### honestly the better question is how he managed to last that long, the way he lived.
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	well, his biographies and contemporary accounts are full of
	different testimonies. some say he died of heatstroke or
	chronically bad health while on a trip,
	&r3a2
		
r3a2:	
	while another guy points out he had been beaten half to death
	a year earlier by unknown assailants.
	&r3a4
	
r3a4:
	that plus some other circumstantial accounts indicate he may have
	been whacked by a bunch of crusader hitmen. one of the other 
	popular ideas is that lead-based paints were popular at the
	time and he might have died of chronic lead poisoning.
	&r3a5
	
r3a5:
	this is mostly backed up by the fact that long term lead poisoning
	can make you unpredictable and violent and the body most people
	are pretty sure was his has a shit-ton of lead in the skeleton.
	&r3a6
	
r3a6:
	i'm predisposed to believe that one because there is something
	deeply resonant about the idea that his artistic drive was the direct
	cause of a slow death by poisoning that drove him to self destructive
	fits that caused him to seek solace in what was killing him.
	&n1

	
###### a reasonable question
r4a1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	oh he did plenty of incredibly impressive things. giant goddamn paintings,
	lighting techniques so refined and influential he damn near became
	synonymous with the term chiaroscuro-
	&r4a2
	
r4a2:
	put it this way he got away with being a douchebag for so long because
	he was a ridiculously talented painter that rich people paid to make
	stuff for them and they didn't like having their staff have to deal
	with things like prison very often
	&r4a3
	
r4a3:
	of course after his death people he'd been a prick to shat on his 
	legacy so hard that he practially disappeared in the minds of art
	hisotrians for 400 years even through people like rembrandt owed
	an arm and a leg to his techniques
	&r4a4
	
r4a4:
	...if you believe in the idea that nobody ever dies until their name's
	spoken for the last time you gotta wonder what it felt like for 
	people like him. what would it feel like in that gap between people
	calling your name? what would it be like to come back from there?
	&n1

n1:
	*setspeaker cat_cello*
	ehhn. starting to get a sore throat from all this yammering.
	gonna go hit the hay in my room which in this instance actually is
	a metaphor for sleep and not some sort of arcane reference
	to drug use.
	&n2
	
n2:
	been nice chatting with you, though.
	see you around. *mark_seen*
