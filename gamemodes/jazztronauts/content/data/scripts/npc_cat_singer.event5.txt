###### START
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> ...Somehow you've been stuck packing novelty hula dolls into this crate.
	The Cellist insisted it was important. Ah well, it's nearly done.
	Just as you bend down to take another armful or dolls, the Mewseum 
	door opens behind you.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> It's the Singer! They wave with their free hand and hurry over towards you.
	They're clearly excited about something, and don't notice the half filled crate
	in their path. You call out, but it's too late!
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> The Singer trips over a hula doll! They flail wildly on the way down, 
	and catch the dinosaur plush on a nail sticking out of the crate!
	&b3
	
b3:
	> The Singer hit the floor pretty hard... and there's.. fluff in the air?
	You peak over the crate and see the Singer cradling a knee. They
	notice the dino plush on the floor, ripped and mangled.
	&b4
	
b4:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer stares down at the torn dinosaur plus in their paws and tears
	leak down their face, a profound aura of deep sorrow settling over them.
	&b5
	
b5:
	> You hurry over and they dont look up at you.
	&b6
	
b6:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>This is the last Event in the Singers's quest line.
	It may take you a while to watch, you can come back to it
	without penalty if you are in a hurry.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Hey, hey it'll be okay. I need to finish something, and then we'll 
		get some supplies and fix 'em up. (exit)
	&r2a1:
		Sure, it looks rough. But it's gonna make a bitching scar.
	&r3a1:
		C'mon. It's okay, I'll help you fix it.
		
###### BRANCH 1 EARLY EXIT
r1a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Slowly they nod. The plush is pulled close to their chest, and you get the 
	feeling they aren't going anywhere until you come back.
	&exit
	
###### BRANCH 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Their head jerks upward, and for a moment their expression is one of numb
	confusion before the tears stop flowing. They wipe their eyes with their jacket
	sleeve, and the tiniest smile flickers on their face.
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	> They pull out their tablet, thankfully unharmed, and slowly tap our a response\:
	"thank you. that made me feel better."
	&r2a3
	
r2a3:
	> Their next message is even shorter as tears threaten again\:
	"dont know what 2 do"
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Hey, hey it'll be okay. I need to finish something, and then we'll 
		get some supplies and fix 'em up. (exit)
	&r3a1:
		C'mon. It's okay, I'll help you fix it.
		
###### BRANCH 3
r3a1:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> They blink. Their reactions seem far slower than normal as they reach for their
	tablet. It's like all the bubble and spark has drained out of them.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	> They message they show you is just one word\: "ok"
	&r3a3

	*wait 2*
	*show*
	> You give the Singer sidelong glances as you set out the needle and thread you pulled
	out of the Mewseum's digital archives. They're huddled up and starting intently at the
	gash in the side of the plush with a morose expression.
	&m1
	
m1:
	> You've gotta nail this.
	&m2
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> While you're carefully pushing the filling back into the wound where it belongs, the
	Singer takes out their tablet and places it on the table between you so you can just 
	see as they type.
	&m3
	
m3:
	> "youve probably been wondering why i dont talk out loud like the rest for a 
	while now. especially given my name. i appreciate very much that you didnt pry.
	&m4
	
m4:
	> "a long time ago i saw something amazing. It was so beautiful, I gasped to 
	catch my breath and find the words to describe it."
	&m5
	
m5:
	> The Singer smiles, and their tapping gets a little more confident.
	&m6
	
m6:
	> "But when I opened my mouth, nothing came out. I was lost for words.
	There was no way I could do justice to what I witnessed."
	&m7
	
m7:
	> "It utterly overwhelmed me with how incredible it was. I'd lost my words
	before, but only for a little while. We kept expecting I'd find them again."
	&m8
	
m8:
	> "But I didn't. And that was okay!!! Everyone was so understanding, even if we 
	didn't perform after that... I felt bad sometimes. Like a burden. Bartender
	told me to cut that shit out pretty fast when she found out!"
	&m9
	
m9:
	> "I've always seen beauty and potential in things the rest didn't, and I knew that
	made me kind of weird. But I don't mind, because it means I see all the good
	in people too!!!"
	&m10
	
m10:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	> You have finished fixing the plush. The Singer bounces in their seat and grabs it
	ip, inspecting your neat fabric-flesh suture work. They pull at their ears, hug you,
	and pull at their ears again.
	&m11
	
m11:
	> They flap their hands under their face and seem almost distressed, until something
	changes. They tap out another message for you.
	&m12
	
m12:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Come with me. I don't have words for how much this means to me. But I can show 
	you another way, I think.
	&m13
	
m13:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	cutscene here of the singer giving a small recital in the performance hall
	> After the final note rings in the air, they come over and clasp both your
	hands before pulling out the tablet again.
	&m14
	
m14:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> "Thank you so much my dear, dear friend for fixing Emily!!!!!"
	&m15
	
m15:
	> "And for listening and letting my be myself! Maybe I can start finding where 
	I lost my words again now  \(=✪ ᆺ ✪=)/"
	player:
	&end:
		I'll help you look. But it's okay if you don't. Those words look just fine.
		
end:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	You share a pleasent moment with the Singer. *mark_seen*
