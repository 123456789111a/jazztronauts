	>The Barsamsara.... the Bartender and Pianist are here.
	
	Though the Pianist appears to be dead, facedown on the bar.
	Wait, no she's moving.
	&b1
	
b1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Y'know. I envy you, PLAYERNAME. At first I thought maybe I hate you?
	But, I did some talking to the Bartender, and I realized it's a different feeling.
	&b2
	
b2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I don't wanna kill you, for one thing, although I did think about it
	for a while. Normally I end up breakin' things I hate, y'see.
	&b3
	
b3:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	But no. S'envy.
	
	You can do whatever you want.
	player:
	&r1a1:
		Well, I know I don't want any part in this. 
		We'll talk when you're sober, 'kay? (Exit)
	&r2a1:
		Thanks for not trying to kill me, I think?
	&r3a1:
		Are you...okay?

	>The Pianist appears to have fallen asleep, judging by the snoring. 
	The Bartender gives you a firm nod.
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Don't worry, I'll make sure she's taken care of.
	&r1a3
	
r1a3:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	The Pianist likes you, you know. That's rather rare.
	Thank you for being her friend, PLAYERNAME.
	*mark_seen*

###### Branch 2
r2a1:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Buddy, if I'd decided to, there would be no try. You'd be a pile of
	gibs floatin' in the lake. But I don't wanna kill you. 
	Like it better when you're alive. You make me like...
	&r2a2
	
r2a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Smile.
	And wanna be a fuckin'. Uhhh. Better person and shit.
	
	Sometimes.

	>She laughs, sharp and sudden like glass breaking.
	&r3a2
	
r3a2:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I am many fuckin' things, PLAYERNAME, but at no point am I "okay".
	You ever have days where you just stop fuckin' thinking?
	&r3a3
	
r3a3:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	That never goes away for me. It's my natural state of being.
	I can't take a shit without planning it advance.
	&r3a4

r3a4:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	Tryin' to find a way around it. Might take up some new.
	Hobby. Somethin' stupid an' dangerous.
	Figure I won't be able to think then, y'know?
	&r3a5
	
r3a5:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	I'm overthinking trying not to overthink fuck my 
	entire life with a rusty rake.
	&r3a6
	
r3a6:
	*setspeaker cat_piano*
	PLAYERNAME. 
	You're good at like.
	Doin' shit on impulse.
	How do?
	player:
	&m1:
		Well-
	&m1:
		Fuck, I-
	&m1:
		Uhhhhhhhhhh-

	>The Pianist's head slams down on the bar counter.
	
	...she appears to have passed out.
	&m2
	
m2:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	>The Bartender walks over to the Pianist, and pats her on the head.
	&m3
	
m3:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Ah.
	There she goes.
	&m4
	
m4:
	*setspeaker narrator*
	>The Bartender sizes you up for a while, then sighs.
	&m5
	
m5:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	The Pianist can't play anymore. Not like she used to. 
	Once she was capable of the most delightful improvisations on the piano,
	it was a marvel to watch.
	&m6
	
m6:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	But shortly after the last group like your left us, she just...
	lost that ability. It's been very distressing for her.
	&m7
	
m7:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Thank you for being her friend. You've brought her more comfort in
	a short time than I've been able to for years. I have no words for how
	deeply I appreciate that.
	&m8
	
m8:
	*setspeaker cat_bar*
	Don't worry, I'll make sure she's taken care of.
