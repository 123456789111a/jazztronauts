# top-level macros for script system
# each line is a macro that will globally replace text when used

# NOTE: Be careful with these, they will replace ANY text in the scripts that match

mycoolmacro value
#   maps any usage of 'mycoolmacro' to 'value'

oncat(name) *setfocus npc_cat_name*
#   will replace any usage of 'oncat(bobby)' with '*setfocus npc_cat_bobby*'
#   you can use argument to specify which parts can be modified

complex_name(v0,v1,v2) first:v0 second:v1 compound(v2): oncat(v2)
#   macros can have names with underscores in them, and also have multiple arguments
#   also you can build compound macros by calling macros which were previously defined
